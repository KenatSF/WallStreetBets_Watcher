1623157287.0,We Need Separate Daily Megathreads For GME / AMC / BB / CLOV,"Having a hundred BB posts a day is pulling out momentum AMC and GME have from this community. It's the same problem we had with GME a couple months ago - the big difference being BB is still not showing comparable gains, and it's not even shorted. So where is *this* amount of support coming from?

Don't get me wrong - I have shares in BB and would love it to moon, but the amount of AMC/GME FUD going on from new accounts where 100% of their post history is pushing BB or fucking SILVER is blowing my mind. That shit's not organic and we see through your bullshit. Again, I say this as someone who's been holding BB since January.

Just make a Daily Megathread for each of these four stocks and call it a day.

/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR/ - check the comments of literally this very thread. Tons and tons of random-ass comments just being like ""SLVR 🚀🍝🍕👌💕🚀🚀"" (insert your own bs pump n dump ticket). Their comment history isn't organic, they're not even remotely on topic, accounts are new as fuck, and they never post in other subreddits.

Bots and employed accounts can literally just spam distraction tickets all day to hijack the daily threads.

1623196290.0,Our Four Leaf $CLOV 🍀,"Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.

Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.

**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).

$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?

**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.

**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)

**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.

**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.

**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.

To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.

Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍

AMA 🗣️

Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don't fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn't even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.

Edit 2: To all the people saying I work at a hedge fund, I'd like to apologize to you and just say that is the funniest thing I've read all day.

But I’m 20 years old, just starting to get into this and $500 is almost a paycheck for me so making $500+ (between CLOV and WISH) is incredible for me which brings me to the reason why I’m making this post in the first place.

1623204652.0,CLOV short squeeze is happening whether you like it or not,"I do not yet own a position in CLOV, but I plan to do so tomorrow after seeing price/movement data today, it is literally just a AMC situation (which I was also in and made a 3x return on) all over again. This looks like the first day of crazy volatility, and i expect this to continue until after the last day when the stock price jumps the most(when retail investors cover) now let’s get into the data, to show why this is actually a even better setup then AMC for a retail short squeeze
Disclaimer: no where in this post am I saying hedge funds have covered in AMC yet, so you die hard apes don’t need to spam me with hate comments.
Now let’s get into it. 

If you go over to fintel you will see volume today was 700 MILLION. Yes you heard that correctly, CLOV, which has a 112 million share float, had on average every share traded 7 TIMES IN ONE F*CKING DAY. For reference, AMC in it’s glory days had like 800 million in volume with a 500 million float. Now there are multiple explanations to why there was so much volume, 1. Is a bunch of day traders and machines  came in to make a quick profit, on top
of all the apes scooping their shares right up to own the float. 
Or 2. Hedge funds with synthetic shares, which is most likely. Today alone there was 200 million shares sold short, while fintel was showing 0 shares available all day. How the hell is 200 million shares shorted possible with 0 shares available? Now keep in mind that most of these synthetics would have been bought right back by a machine after no less then a second to make a .1 percent return on them, because if they just sold 200 million shares at a time to the open market the price would be at 2 dollars right now, but it still shows the manipulation and the desperation from them to keep the stock price suppressed. 

Either way all the volume on top of the synthetics show how much new apes are coming in and buying up the float, there has been 0 or close to 0 shares available to borrow for a day or two now, meaning retail can’t actually double down on their short positions or open new ones, which also means with continued losses they will be forced to cover since they can’t average up. 

Now If we go over to ortex, or ortex’s twitter, we can see that CLOV currently has 51 million shares that are borrowed and waiting to be returned.  That is 45 percent of the float. A 45 percent short interest compared to AMC before retail covered was around 30 percent. With just a 4th of the buying power compared to AMC, our short squeeze can take us to 100 easily(our float is a 4th of AMC’s). If we can achieve the same kind of cult following that AMC got, we are looking at a GME TYPE OF RUN! 
And for the love of all that is holy, guys please wait to buy until 8:30 AM eastern so I can pick up shares before it goes to 50, appreciate it 😘.",349,0,nvkr22,Caleb0000003,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvkr22/clov_short_squeeze_is_happening_whether_you_like/,False,217

1623179743.0,WISH is more than a short squeeze,"Sure SI is high, possible gamma/short squeeze, etc etc. That's all documented in other posts. I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?

**Valuation:**

Earning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing

P/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)

**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**

Revenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.

One of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.

**Balance book:**

WISH has $1.6B cash. \~$2B total assets, \~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. 

**Insider selling:**

Another concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.

**Technicals:**

Again, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.

**Conclusions:**

From a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \~1, and that would be absurd.",988,0,nvbws4,CMScientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvbws4/wish_is_more_than_a_short_squeeze/,False,258

1623195496.0,WKHS DD,"Highest shorted stock and a small cap stock what else can I say. 

&#x200B;

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen & Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

**OK APES IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING START TO THE SUMMER ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET EVEN MORE INTERESTING**

All our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true. Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again. Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money. (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded). Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:

**CLNE.**

Now don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked. But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.

**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?**

Well, it's the only one with the government on our side. Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles? This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call ""Renewable Natural Gas"" (RNG).

**So how the fuck are they doing this??**

Let me explain. The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us. But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative. And who eats this shit up?? Amazon. Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses. Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.

**Price**

The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being. I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that. Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10. The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00

[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)

It's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate. The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short. That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.

**The Play?**

Shares. The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely. And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.

It's clearly short hunting season and it looks like we've had quite a healthy catch. Short sellers have their fingers on the panic button and are bailing out at any threat of a rabid pack of retards stomping around, pounding their chests, talking shit, and smashing their ill-gotten gains onto the backs juicy meme tickers. And, yet, the shorts do not fear the originators of such apeish behavior: Pro Wrestlers.

# How I found WWE

Let me introduce to you my patented SMELL system. The acronym is reverse engineered to make sense for this ticker and so it might seem like I was piledrived as a child, but bear with me. It's important to put memes first. Here it goes:

* **S**hort Interest is high
* **M**arket cap is high
* **E**xtremely Memeable
* **L**ow IV
* **L**ow Float

Basically, I sniffed around for stocks that would benefit the most from even a tiny amount of short covering. Probably the most important thing here is Low IV. That means the stock has to go up less for me to profit and later expirations are cheap (because I can't time wtf you guys are doing). But it also means if the ticker catches fire the IV will spike up, further resulting in massive profit.

I was quite surprised that WWE came up high on my list. As I dug into it, I was expecting that the SMELL was from sweaty redneck chads wearing spandex, surrounded by thousands of teens in Iron Maiden t-shirts who have yet to discover deodorant -- but it turns out the odor was instead the smell of bears pissing themselves.


# I: Fundamentals

I don't know anything about books of companies. You're asking the wrong guy.

However, [this guy on SA](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416217-wwe-powerful-sports-entertainment-franchise), and many others, seem quite excited about WWE. Perhaps as children WWE superstars provided some semblance of a father figure to them. Or, perhaps, they enjoy having their homoerotic fantasies fulfilled while writing about stocks. Either way, they did all the work. So go read their stuff and you'll find WWE is solid, possibly Rock solid.

For those even lazier than myself, here are the cliff notes:

* They are effectively a monopoly on pro wrestling, which is apparently growing in popularity
* They make money from [Media, Live Events, and Consumer Products](https://imgur.com/HFAUWJl).
* COVID wasn't too bad for them. It cut Live Events, but [Media revenue popped up](https://imgur.com/IplD7p8).
* Live Events are coming back... and they're taking it international. This will significantly boost their revenues, especially since during COVID it was zero.
* Strong social media following (more YouTube subs than NBA, NFL, and GME combined). More IG followers than NFL.
* PT of $75/sh from [some fancy FCF model thing](https://imgur.com/2lqYlSE)
* Lots of aquisition suitors


# II: Catalysts

I'd be kidding myself if I thought you guys cared about catalysts, or that they even matter right now, but here are two big ones anyway.

**Live Events Resuming**

WWE will resume touring. Despite this revenue being missing in 2020, they managed to haul in nearly a billion dollars. So the second half this year, and all of next year, is going to be pretty good. Not only will revenues be driven up, but fan engagement and brand appeal will go up as well. WWE's IP has a ton of value and they've leveraged it well during COVID.. as live events come back and increase engagement, it should provide some synergy to everything else they sell -- PPV, IP rights, merchandise, etc. That's just my opinion, so please do not let the excitement of the return of live events distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

**Video Games are booming**

WWE Supercard is Take Two Interactive's (a $52b company) highest grossing mobile game, and it's growing at around 23% YOY. A lot of that money will flow into WWE. WWE also sells rights to other titles. As video games continue to grow, so to does WWEs revenue.

**Rumors of acquisition**

About a week ago, WWE cut some talent assets. Some apparently important guy tweeted that it's likely due to them cutting costs and preparing for an acquisition. [Here are Reddit wrestler fans discussing this (1200 comments)](https://old.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/nqovvd/former_writer_dave_schilling_ummm_i_think_wwe_is/)

Rumors aside, there is a strong case for WWE being acquired, should McMahon decide to sell. From the SA article:

> It is not unrealistic to suggest that WWE could one day be acquired. If McMahon indicated an interest to sell the business, there would be no shortage of potential suitors given the scarcity value of its content. Whilst Disney, Fox and Viacom could be prospective interested parties, arguably top of the list is Comcast, who may decide owning WWE may generate more value to its shareholders than perpetually leasing its content.

# III: Technicals

This is closer to my specialty, and it's why WWE is my new favorite squeeze play.

**High SI**: [Exchange reported SI around 8m shares](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/WWE/short-interest/) as reported May 14. Ortex shows this number has held steady even throughout this squeeze cycle. I'm imaging the shorts are trying to slowly cover to keep this under the radar, but can't help but push the stock up little by little. While the SI % Float appears to be 18%, there's more to it than that...

**Low Float**: The float on this is around 44m shares. However, the company is hedging it's convertible notes (representing about 8m shares if converted) via ISDA OTC contracts with 3 banks: [JPM](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex102.htm), [MS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex104.htm), and [Citi](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex106.htm). Basically, these banks sold $38m of options, at a strike of $24.91. These are *deep ITM* options, that are pretty much fully delta hedged. **So if these banks were doing their jobs and deltahedging, that's 8m shares of commons they hold, locked up. That takes the float down to 36m shares.**

**Low Volume**: The volume of this ticker is insanely low. So, there's not a huge market of interested parties looking to buy/sell shares. That basically means as shorts cover the price will move up more. Higher days-to-cover, and higher impact of gamma ramps, which I'll get to later.

**Low IV**: To top it off, the options on this thing are cheap as well. I'm holding LEAPs and some July's in the hope that if there's any kind of squeeze, the IV will pop up substantially. That's where the real gains are in these squeeze plays... getting in before the IV pops. CLNE had a similar situation, but it's IV was originally around 80, not 40. It popped up 3%, but the options values went up 10-20x overnight primarily from the IV jump. It's insane to me IV is this low on WWE.

**Pressure on the shorts**: The stock is at levels last seen in Dec 2019, so anybody shorting it after then is red. The average age of SI, [according to Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/8Wbox.png), is 102 days. It's pretty safe to say the majority of shorts are already underwater at this point.

So, putting it all together:  SI % Float appears as 18%, but it's really closer to 22%. That's good enough for me because: the volume is low, the shorts are in the red, and it's squeezing season. Most importantly, the IV for this is priced as though it's some boomer stock.

With IVs this low, it doesn't take much for options to print bigly. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), aka elasticity, of options is huge. Omega measures how much the option value moves with respect to the underlying. For example, with July 16 $65C, If WWE goes up .1%, option value goes up 1.6% (~16x). That's because IV is so low. I'll happily take those odds.

% Float per % underlying change values of >0.30%+ get me excited, and we're only at 0.14%. However, I'm a little bitch and have high standards. 0.14% float deltahedged per 1% price move is still significant. For reference, right now, CLNE is at these numbers. Most tickers are well below that (around 0.05%).

I wouldn't say there's any significant gamma going on here, yet. The options chain is pretty scare, aside from the gazillion options held by those banks (which are considered in this chain). You can see 20% of float deltahedged -- that's primarily from those options.

What really gets me excited is the % Volume numbers. The gamma ramp is much stronger in that regard -- if you believe volume is more indicative of lower liquidity than float, then 4.00%+ are sizeable numbers. Put in English, if the stock moves up 1%, then 5.75% of the daily volume will need to be purchased as a deltahedge (assuming all options written are deltahedged). To me, that's significant, and can help multiply any upward movement.

The best part? The chain is rather scarce. Throw on a few thousand $60/$65 calls into the OI, and the ramp will extend out and become stronger.

# V: Conclusion

If you want a low-risk, high-reward play on squeeze season, this is my pick. It's got everything, and the options are dirt cheap. On today's 3% move, even my Jan leaps printed 12%. My FDs are up 30-60%.. and I think this is only the beginning.

If you want to play the company on fundamentals, but still have some exposure to a squeeze event, you cannot go wrong with Jan LEAPs. Stay ATM or just tad OTM (if you want to collect on IVs going up).

Looking at the options chain also shows that call options for over 8 million shares have gone ITM since yesterday’s close. 

Last reported short interest was 40 million shares on may 14. This is about twice the short interest of AMC before last weeks squeeze. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV?p=CLOV

This looks like the perfect setup for a combined short and gamma squeeze. I see no reason why CLOV couldn’t reach the same price point as AMC did last week (>$70). It might even go higher than that.


Edit: updated estimated short interest data from Ortex by u/idster put it at 44% of float (cfr AMC @ 12% and GME @ 18%).

1623207395.0,"$WISH - world's most downloaded shopping app is a value play, MEGA DD!","Many autists wished for DD on $WISH. Here you go!

The DD here is purely looking at WISH as a pure value play and doesn't include any short-squeeze related information.

# Business

To keep it simple,

1. Wish is a global e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
2. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.
3. The merchants on the platform primarily offer ***unbranded products that are deeply discounted compared to the alternatives. Most of the merchants/products are from china.***
4. They target customers looking for value goods people with annual income < 75,000 USD, plenty in US and Europe regions accounting for 90% of customers.
5. Wish does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

# The Team

1. *CEO* [*Piotr Szulczewski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Szulczewski) *a former Google Engineer*
2. *Exec chair - Jacky Reses (known for Square and works with Bill Ackman at Pershing square)*
3. *CTO - DannyZhang (Ex- Yahoo, ATT)*
4. *Best in class Technology team of engineers mostly from Facebook and Google*

Hunky dory there are so many e-commerce platforms why is WISH special ?

# Value Proposition

Looks at some of the stats here

[Activity Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/hp99fuab85471.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a48935ccd3b4142a9070ac354568d30eab0c10)

WISH platform connects over ***100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 550k global merchants***. Their main motto is to give users an affordable, personalized, and entertaining shopping experience leveraging their in house data science and marketing technologies.

# Value Proposition to Wish Users

The platform excels from the rest by making e-commerce

**Affordable -** Offer unbranded products to value conscious customers at deep discounts

1. **Accessible -**  built as a Mobile first platform for access across the world in 40 different languages
2. **WISH Local -** Partner with 50,000 brick and mortar stores, use them as pick up facilities and also allowing the stores to list their products on the platform

The standout features of the shopping experience

1. **90% of user activity occurs through Mobile App**
2. ***Discovery Based***  **- 70% of the sales on the platform do not come from a search query, meaning the user doesn't come to the platform to buy something that's on his mind but rather ends up buying a product browsing through the platform liking a deal**
3. Their marketing programs are top notch and they use big data technologies and AI in their approach to make it highly personalized. They look at facebook, instagaram, emails and messages to customize their recommendations. ***ok most of you that have seen The social Dilemma on NFLX. you got it.***
4. user experience is engaging and entertaining by having highly personalized feeds. on an ***average users spent over \~ 9 minutes a day*** on their platform in 2020

# What's in for the merchants in addition to being able to sell their products ?

1. access to 100 mil monthly users across 100 countries, digital presence for their stores
2. Through **ProductBoost,** they are able to market their products by paying WISH as ad revenue. **This is very similar to a TinderBoost feature. 30% of merchants use this feature**
3. WISH charges and offers logistics ensuring consistent delivery experience boosting their sales.

# Revenue sources

1. **Core Marketplace** \~ commission on the products being sold on the platform
2. **ProductBoost** \~ marketing ad dollars coming from the merchants
3. **Logistics** \~ providing logistics support to the merchants and getting paid

# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&#x200B;

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

**Positions or ban**

1. This stock is ACTUALLY heavily shorted. Users with YOLO positions already in place have made this clear. Currently around 11.5% of the float is sold short, and with a float of 272 million shares, that's pretty sizable.
2. Check out this beauty of a chart

1623204802.0,Fintel Estimates $BB Short Volume Ratio (25%) Currently Higher than $GME (24%) or $AMC (21%). We're all in this together.," Currently, Fintel is estimating $BB has a daily short volume ratio of 25%

For comparison, $GME is estimated as 24% 

And $AMC is 21%

Now, we all know these are not 100% known quantities as some things are happening behind closed doors (good job, SEC), but it's interesting to see that the more $BB has gone up, the more it is being shorted (scroll down to see it increasing every day on Fintel).

And what was silly at first has now become a real possibility for a $BB short squeeze happening. I believe it has gone from 9% to 24% since this push started.

This also helps explain how the movements of these stocks are so lockstep recently, especially $BB and $AMC. The hedge funds are acting on them in a similar fashion.

$GME's daily movement is similar but slightly different, likely as such a higher entry cost now.

# Why?

$CLF AKA Cleveland Cliffs is one of the **largest producers of steel in america.**

Have you tried building a house? Getting gym gear? Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**

**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel. Steel prices went to the moon! THEY FUCKING TRIPLED!**

🌏 🚀 🌕

&#x200B;

[In a matter of months prices for steel TRIPLED](https://preview.redd.it/bir35uvtt7471.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aecc3e0e75d8551b90c57135f81c186c0ecc152b)

&#x200B;

# WHY $CLF?

# Because $CLF is a big fucking steel producer, profitable, undervalued as fuck, forecast EBIDTA of $5.6B at a share price of 20$! RIGHT NOW $CLF should be worth at LEAST 35$, and that's not even counting in that HRC prices are over 1600$

🚀

# SHORTS TRYING TO BEAT DOWN $CLF! 🚀

# Look at the chart:

**Price of steel increases over 50% in the same time, but CLF just trades 2$ higher than it did nearly 6 months ago? HOW is that possible?!**

&#x200B;

[2$ in nearly 6 months while the product increases over 50&#37; in price in the same time?!](https://preview.redd.it/uztdva1yt7471.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c97042edaaa86ab560ecb5b3df38357913928cd5)

&#x200B;

How do you explain, that a company that is this big, produces steel for whole america and where the **product price was raised by 50% and PEOPLE ARE STILL GRABBING IT LIKE ITS BLACK FRIDAY**.

&#x200B;

Waiting times on steel orders for big companies are as **over 3 MONTHS** and more with the buyers paying any price the company wants. **That means with the same steel output the company now EARNS 50% MORE per ton of steel than it did in january!**

But the share price only rose 2$ since january, just about 10%? Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Let's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**

Obviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.

# WHY CLF - A CHAD CEO 🚀 🚀 :

# CEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud. HE knows the analysts are wrong and he KNOWS that people are shorting his company. And he WANTS TO FUCKING FUCK EM.

google CLF earnings call transcript

Read what he tells to journalists and analysts:

""**And then you say, well, Lourenco, the clients are complaining that they are not receiving steel. Yes**\[...\]. So they are basically collecting what they pointed for and we are taking good care of some of them, **some others we are not taking care** because I don't believe that they don't, they really even belong.""

**THEY JUST FUCKING DONT CARE about people complaining the prices are too high.**

""**Because we don't need all of this ""opportunistic"" players in the marketplace. They just destroy, complicate, gossip, talk on the phone, send fake information, do everything that we only done in the marketplace.** \[...\]. **So that's what we were working for. We are doing our mandate. We are doing our job. We are working on behalf of the shareholders of the company.**

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **CLF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, have a ton of **CASH** and **shorts fucking with them** all the time. Look at the chart and tell me there is no reason with INSANE steel prices the **stock trades at JANUARY levels.**

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

# TLDR: 🚀

# $CLF is an american company that makes BANK, earns tons of money because steel prices went through the roof and are still trading at levels they were in january, but the product costs 50% more than it did in january. Their CEO is HELLBENT on crushing shortsellers and bad analysts.

# Fair price of $CLF should be at least 35$-40$.

Positions: tons of german call warrants, a load of July 20c calls, Oct 22c calls. About to add more. Obviously no financial advice, I just like the stock.

A combination of **high short interest, low float, increasing call volume** and **volatility expansion** (leading to IV expansion) will force Market Makers to delta and gamma hedge and shorts to capitulate themselves into a death spiral.

**All signals are GO. It's a fucknado powder keg about to explode.**

What will happen next? If you look at the 1min chart, $CLF is primed to break the 21.50$ price resistance all-time-high, and afterwards **there will be no reason for anyone holding any $CLF for the past 5 years to sell**. **This is the same story as $WISH:**

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

Not only that but unlike some other short traps (like WISH which had a very low float so short % was artificially high), WISH's float is 85% of its shares outstanding so the short interest cannot be lowered simply by releasing shares from lockup. 

This all sets up for a massive squeeze in a short time span as short sellers simply cannot pay such a high borrow rate especially with shorts being targeted, the panic will set in soon and this will easily take off to $25 or higher.

GME - Super star, the Michael Jordan of “meme” stocks. Heavily shorted, big money hates them. Very long on this stock. Potentials: Gamma + Short Squeeze

AMC - the Scottie Pippen to the bulls. Very shorted, big money hates them. Potentials: Short Squeeze

CLOV - The Kawhi Leonard, undervalued. One of the highest shorted stocks on the market next to the likes of Workhorse and Wish. Will be added to the Russell index. Healthcare technology company. Big money hates them. Shorted 40%+. Potentials: Continued Gamma + Short Squeeze.

WISH - The Kyle Lowry of stocks. Super undervalued. Has a lot of great catalysts going for it. Heavily shorted I believe @ 51%. Potential: Gamma Squeeze + Short Squeeze.

WKHS - The Kevin Durant of sorts. Very high short interest. Another great play in the works. Potential: Gamma Squeeze + Short Squeeze.

BB - Very undervalued company. Huge future potential in expansion. Potential: Undervalue card + Gamma Squeeze.

CLNE - Very undervalued company. Has huge innovations in development, carbon negative, provides clean energy solutions and has government contracts. Potential: Undervalue card + Gamma Squeeze

UWMC - Very undervalued. 34% market share and growing. Cash and Revenue positive by a lot. CEO supports shareholders and has announce share buyback of up to 300M. High SI% of ~20%. Dividend payouts today (Shorts to cover), possible Russell inclusion being appealed. Potential: Undervalue card + Gamma Squeeze + Short Squeeze.

Sitting right at the top of the Bollinger band, strong signal that the upside will continue. Still large volume today and yesterday means that the \~$15-16 USD range is going to act as a strong base for us going forward.  
200DMA moving upwards, Bollinger Bands slightly still expanding, looks bullish. 

The hourly chart will paint us a better picture for our baseline.  


https://preview.redd.it/yk78c534e6471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31b4e32c5bd961cdfd1b9f7813cd60e8c965d62

MASSIVE wall at 14.50, just as I've been strongly stating throughout this run. It acted as the signal to the upside on the left arrow, when we sold off it acted as support with a strong bounce, and again another test and won back.   
14.50 will continue to be acting as strong support moving forward, if we fail a test at 14.50 I would expect 12.10 to come.

Bollinger Bands are tightening again indicating price movement is imminent. This can be in part of the fact of the BB Investor Information Seminar tomorrow  
([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)) 

### Baird 2021 Global Consumer, Technology & Services Conference

I doubt anything huge will be announced here but more information is always better.  
RSI looking healthy.

Upwards wedge appears to be forming and lines up nicely with the Bollinger Bands. There will be movement either tomorrow or Thursday I am expecting a  20% pop to the upside.  
A lot of calls at $15 this week, expect to stay above this with all the strength and momentum BB is showing right now.  


Immediate resistance shows \~$17.20 USD. Acted as support in the January run on the 25th and 26th but now is acting as a strong wall. After $17.20, $20 is easily in sight.

  
Reducing my EOW target of $24-33 to $20-24, to stay conservative, though one solid piece of news tomorrow can make the difference.  


Volume is critical. Definitely has slowed down Friday Monday and again today but eyes are still on us. This is technically speaking this is great play right now, run up hard with a healthy pullback into a cup and handle. Strong baseline which is pushing higher highs and higher lows. Massive support at 14.50 with strong upside potential. Easy 50% gains if volume comes back  
Still extremely bullish.

How high can $WISH go?

Pre-market is at $15 with a volume gap and no resistance until $20. From $20 upwards, the path is rockier BUT... We did see a lot of call volume at $20 and even more at $25. So if price reaches and is able to break that higher resistance up to $25, then it's fly high land

This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

https://youtu.be/kcagi2icXaU

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term.

BARK completed its merger with a SPAC last week.

It is now supercharged and a growth stock that has moonshot potential written all over it.

**And, it is HUGELY shorted: 106% S.I.**

The BARK Company, best known as BarkBox, provides dog-focused products and services to pet owners. Though you'll find its products in 23,000 retail doors, it's predominantly an e-commerce company that relies on high-margin subscriptions. 

As of the end of March, it had 1.2 million subscribers, up 91% from the prior-year period. BARJ's S-1 filing notes that monthly product retention is higher than it's ever been, which signifies that a high percentage of subscribers aren't cancelling.

If this isn't convincing enough, consider that it's been more than a quarter of a century since year-over-year pet expenditures declined in the United States. This year alone, the American Pet Products Association expects nearly $110 billion will be spent on companion animals, $44.1 billion of which is on food and treats, which is BarkBox's specialty.

Innovation is also important for BARK. Last year, it introduced Bark Home, which allows dog owners to purchase basic-need accessories like collars and beds, and Bark Eats, a program that personalizes and delivers a high-quality dry food diet to dog owners.

Having been here since before GameStop in January ( not by much), all of a sudden this sub is all about teamwork and taking down the corporate elite and “please we need help for stock XYZ!!!” or “ignore ABC!! You fools!! It’s all about 123!!!” All from accounts that are made in the last three to four months.

For fucks sake, this is not a team effort. This is not a bunch of masked individuals here to help you get out of the hole you dug by betting your rent money or your fucking aunt may’s entire pocket book on stocks that rise and fall by the swing of your dick! We are all here to make money and I wish everyone could remember WSB in its prime where you only posted actual shitpost memes from gladiator or some high quality material once in awhile to break up the real and massive loss/gain/yolo porn. That made it a little better when sifting through the scum of posts with ass DD to find that diamond in the rough of someone who posted something NEW or actually added info instead of repeating the same echo chamber of a false hope that “___ is the next BIG SQUEEEEZE” 

How about you gamma squeeze these nuts, shut the fuck up, and read instead of posting more bullshit for the mods to wipe clean like a triple-ply once-over clandestine shit sweep. These mods are heroes for listening to this cringy begging ape shit for months now, so try to make their lives easier and learn something in the process. 

Today was a bloodbath for memes, so welcome to fucking Valhalla you shit for brains monkeys, the keys to get out are on the next play if you managed not to lose it all or have another aunt to short squeeze.

1623339311.0,WallStreetBets. What it is; and What it isn't.,"The name of this subreddit is WallStreet**BETS**. Not WallStreet-Long-Term-Holds. Not WallStreet-Societal-Change-Needed. Not WallStreet-Stick-It-to-the-Man. Not WallStreet-Down-with-Hedge-Funds.

It is WallStreet**BETS**. This sub was started to discuss and trade FD’s. If you don’t know what that means, then you probably don’t belong here. This sub was dedicated to 0dte puts & calls. Again, if that term is unfamiliar to you, then you probably shouldn't be here. This sub discusses strategies and plays on high-risk, short-duration, option contracts on stocks, stock indexes, ETF’s, and related securities, namely **dailies**. This sub’s idea of a long-term investment strategy is buying weeklies. This sub is most likely made up of people with ADHD, who can’t see past tomorrow, and have already forgotten what they had for breakfast.

Occasionally, the play may be to buy and hold a stock for a short duration, but that is an exception, not the rule.

If you want to buy and hold a security to effect change, or to stick it to the hedge funds, or to shake your fist at the Wall Street elite, then there are other subreddits for that. That is not **THIS** subreddit’s mantra.

This sub has only one mantra: that is to make money daily. Period. We measure wins & losses in 24-hr increments. And the only thing that counts is the amount in your account at the end of the day.

This sub is not a “get-rich-quick” scheme. That kind of thinking leads to “get-poor-quick” results.

This sub views the stock market as a casino. Like any casino, there are strategies you can employ to improve your odds. And that is what is (or should be) discussed here.

And like a casino, there is a high degree of risk; including risk of total loss. Do not be fooled, you should expect losses. The stock market is a “zero-sum-game”. For every winner, there must be a loser. It takes two (2) people to effect a trade. For every buyer, there is a seller. For every “+”, there is a “-“.

This sub is **NOT** a collective. Collective action is tantamount to collusion, which can lead to market manipulation, and that is **NOT** what this sub is about. That shit will get you 10 years in ClubFed.

And lastly, for God’s sake, we are **NOT** apes. If anything, we are **nerds**. Math nerds. Numbers nerds. And damn proud of it. We discuss the Greek’s. And if you don’t know what that means, then really, **REALLY**, you don’t belong here.

If you want to lurk here and learn, then by all means, please do. Ask questions. We will most likely make fun of you, but ask. Someone nice will answer your question.

**EDITORS NOTE**: Please excuse my very short account life. I am not an OG WSB, but I do get what the intention of this sub was, and I’m getting tired of reading off-topic posts and comments. I came here to make money, not to rise up against the establishment.

**TL;DR** : This is **NOT** a collective, this is a **CASINO**.

**EDIT #1**: I stand corrected on one critical point. An OG WSB graciously pointed out that daily's, weekly's, monthly's, LEAPS, and swing trades on stocks have always been welcomed here.

1623344307.0,AMC. WHOS WITH ME. 🦧,"Today is a big day, and this week is a big week. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.
I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.
- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021
- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting
- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.
Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192
- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:
Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6%
Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%
Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2%
Insider Ownership 6.5%
Other 67.4%

Total of institution ownership:
12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%
Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors:
26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%
Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:
32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares
Shares needed to cover the records:
-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M
- Synthetic shares:
total number of synthetic shares: Z
naked shorts: X
naked call contracts: Y
other naked shares: W
Z = X + Y + W
Short interest:
Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares
Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records:
100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)
Hidden number of synthetic shares:
U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.
Minimum number of synthetic shares
37M + U
- Bottom line:
37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.

Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. GLTL.",2548,0,nwskjd,vondizzel,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwskjd/amc_whos_with_me/,False,382

1623363262.0,The Key to Blackberry,"Buy and hold! and accumulate much as you can while they keep the stock price low. 

i know many of us are armed with Robinhood and we're trigger happy with buy/sell but if you want to win you must learn to buy and hold. Yes, Blackberry is one of those stock. In my view it's massively undervalued Cyber Security and IoT company. Their Blackberry Spark platform is taking over everything and overtaking Crowdstrike business too. How i make this assessment? Simple, if Crowdstrike was a good technology compnay the entire US federal government would be using it....BUT there're NOT! they are going to Blackberry.  **Blackberry has integrated artificial intelligence into all their products now.** 

Even IBM has decided to ditch their own cyber security software and switched to selling Blackberry Spark suite in Canada. When one of your biggest competitor ditches their own product and starts selling your product, that's a sign that you have an amazing crazy magic like product. 

[here's the proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-and-ibm-canada-establish-a-new-partnership)

Compared to industry the blackberry spark artificial intelligence machine is years in advance. **No other** ai based cyber security comes close to blackberry engine, this is why US government and 77% of fortune 100 companies have switched to blackberry. i will list their growing customers(big enterprises) in next part. **BB holds the biggest ai patent portfolio in cyber security!!**

Revenue growth will explode in coming months and quarters. The ai based spark platform was launched last year and it took them few months to get their ducks and marketing in row! 

Next article i will dive deep into their latest product called Blackberry Persona! it's a god like ai that stops insider threats and stolen password(the pipeline hack could have been prevented if they had used blackberry). Password will be history and no longer will be required as we move into the future.

1623359648.0,A more serious take on why CLNE is an important play in the coming week(s),"First of all I want to [link this post that explains the price action that CLNE needs to reach it’s target price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns9i8r/clne_only_needs_moderate_price_action_over_next/) in order to trigger ITM call options before the 18th, which is $13. Price will absolutely fly once this happen and potentially before if people get in. We only need to buy and hold for nearly a week for this to happen. Look up any previous DD post on CLNE where they explain the reason it is being shorted (revenue growth is expected in the medium to long term so it looks like easy money for hedge funds). [Here is a link with short interest over the past year for anyone lazy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clne/short-interest).

CLNE also has several partnerships in the works including a large deal to provide RNG (carbon renewable natural gas) to Amazon for their delivery trucks, and in general green energy is growing priority for the USA and the world in general. As someone who is probably most risk averse than most people here, this makes me feel better as I can always hold in case of a sudden dip for longer term gains.

I also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business).

CLNE has also not even reached it’s all time high of $16 yet, whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing. Not blaming anyone, gains are gains.

Volume picked up at the end of today as attention shifted away from some of the shorter plays. I’ve held a small stake since I read [this article back in April](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005219/en/Clean-Energy-Signs-Agreement-with-Amazon-for-Low-and-Negative-Carbon-RNG), however I’ve added more as the meme potential has built up as this subreddit is starting to have a lot of influence I’m wishing I put more than 10k in but gains are gains, and hopefully you learned something from this. Just trying to bring some more serious discussion to the chaos of the last couple weeks haha.

Oh and apes together strong or something, cow farts and godspeed retards. Good luck no matter what stocks you're in! 

\*\*\*\*Just want to add that this does NOT mean there will be a squeeze for sure, there’s been a lot of misinformation on this and posts addressing this.

1623347010.0,$WKHS and why it could be a Nobrainer,"Hey guys,

(repost because automod ... probably)

(tldr at the end)

first of all:

* this is not a ""bring the hedges down all GME"" Post.
* Its just about making some quick bucks in a short amount of time.

Okay let's go.

First  of all as you probably know $WKHS is one (if not the) most shorted  stock on Wall Street. Tbh I dont care about that much, but its surely a  good thing to know.

Facts:

WKHS (Workhorse ( [https://workhorse.com/](https://workhorse.com/) )) is a delivery tech company.

They manufacture the cars and drones for delivery companys.

Their fleet only contains 100% electric cars with moderate range and deluvery drones.

>Workhorse is a technology company focused on providing drone-integrated electric vehicles to the last-mile delivery sector

finacials:

they have 200mil in cash so they have some money left to invest.

Sales  for the first quarter of 2021 were recorded at approximately  $521,000  compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020 (an  incerase of 620% within a year)

As you can see there was a sharp selloff after they didnt get a contract with USPS.

The  good thing we see here is that we are in the old channel between \~15$  and \~30$ + the selloff happend so rapidly that from 15 to 30$ there is  not mayor resistance except \~18$.

\+ Heavy support on 15$ since last year

so what that means is that on a way of a nearly 100% increase the is only one mayor resistance.

We are probably right in the beginning of a 100% increase in the next coming weeks.

We are literally at the biggest support line of this stock right now in this moment.

Tactics:

Because  this stock is extreme volatile I will go with stocks only this time.  average buy is at \~16$ (bought 500 at 17$ and 500 near 15$)

will  hold 50% of my stocks until we reach 30$, after that I see what happens  next (probably it goes even further or I sell if it goes down to 25$).

TL;DR

* highly shortet stock with good money managment and a good looking future
* a possible increase of 100% in the next 2-5 weeks.
* literally at the bottom

1623326513.0,CLF - we like our steel now 💎🙌🚀,"U.S. is the world's most-expensive steel market, steel prices are high overseas at the moment too, discouraging buyers in the U.S. from pursuing imports. Spot-market prices for hot-rolled coiled steel in Southeast Asia are $900 a metric ton, and the cost of a shipping container has more than doubled since the start of the year. 

Imports, which typically make up about a quarter of the finished steel consumed in the U.S. annually, last year accounted for 18%, the lowest share since 2003, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. So far this year, imports have been running at about the same rate, the trade group said. U.S. tariffs, high prices and growing demand for steel in foreign markets are holding down import volumes.

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is keeping about seven million tons of production capacity out of service. That is roughly a tenth of domestic consumption in 2019, according to Metal Strategies Inc., an industry consulting firm. 

Steel prices, meanwhile, have reached records. Spot-market steel prices have climbed more than 60% since the start of the year to more than $1,600 a ton, according to S&P Global Platts. 

TL;DR - Steel companies are share price has been reflecting this demand. Suppose you look at NUE, X, MT over the past year.

1623362420.0,Why $CLNE is more than a hype stock and why I’m bullish for the next 5+ years,"$CLNE presents a promising future and attractive opportunity for investors given the energy transition the world is undergoing. With CLNE’S established brand and reputation in the renewable gas industry, I believe they are well-positioned to serve the growing demands for RNG. 

Company Overview

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.

RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.

2020 Financial Results

**Revenue:** CLNE’s 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&M services. Despite 2020’s bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.

**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they’ll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that’ll help with seeing shareholder returns.

**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE’s lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company’s ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (

Recent Developments

**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon’s action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.

**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M.  This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.

**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron’s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.

Investment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG

The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it’s used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:

* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord
* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years
* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050

Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.

**Final Thoughts**

With CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport

1623362071.0,"SENS (32% shorted) can be a 10x candidate from here. Warning extreme DD, requires wrinkled brain.","Senseonics Holdings, Inc., is a medical technology company, that develops and manufactures a unique implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.

Eversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.

The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.

Enter Ascensia Diabetes

On August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.

Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?

I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google ""Blood glucose monitoring"" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.

Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.

The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.

With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.

Currently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.

The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.

Senseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels. Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA, then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September.",253,0,nwzmjz,HaveADrinkOnMeCosby,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwzmjz/sens_32_shorted_can_be_a_10x_candidate_from_here/,False,126
1623375683.0,WISH has seen a bottom.,"Certain aspects of the market have been brutalized over the last few months. In particular, pre revenue stocks with high growth prospects have been hit especially hard. The reason being is that the market was reacting to skyrocketing inflation. The rationale for this is that the higher future earnings of these companies will not have as much purchasing power as a result of inflation. As a result, the market began to rotate into cyclical stocks that will do well in an inflationary environment because they have earning power right here, right now. With the whopping 5% inflation numbers that came out, the market has actually reversed the rotation into cyclical stocks in response. This to me, indicates that the market has priced in inflation based fears. I believe that this gives high growth stocks like WISH the green light to rally again. With this as a tailwind, enormous short interest, and an army of apes behind it, I think WISH is the perfect target right now. It’s still down 50% from its IPO price!

In past DD's and most recently in LG's revised guidance, we know that HRC will be averaging much more than is currently baked in:

The Company’s forecast includes the following expectations:

* First-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA\* of approximately $500 million
* Second-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA\* of approximately $1.2 billion
* Full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA\* of approximately $3.5 billion

The full-year expectation is based on current contractual business and the assumption that the US HRC price averages $975 per net ton for the remainder of the year.

**$975 per net ton!**

Maybe, $975 per 6/10 of a ton.

My prediction is $1,200 minimum and remember, we will start to realize those profits in Q2 and especially Q3.

Why this company is being shorted is beyond lunacy, it's pure greed and they think they can hammer a boomer stock that no one cares about.

Until yesterday when it made the headlines as the NEW MEME stock.

Well, this stock is not a meme, its actually a fucking stud that is run by a bigger fucking stud named LG.

If you were going to bet on 5 CEO's today for me they would be:

Jeff Bezos

Tim Cook

Elon Musk

Lisa Su

Lourenco Goncalves

Why do I put LG in the pantheon of these titans?

Two reasons:

So, do you want to go chase dog shit companies that don't make money and are the flavor of the day or would you like to invest in a company that is making a shit ton of money, in an environment where the product they manufacture is in the highest demand we have seen in decades and there is not enough supply to quench the international thirst?

Or

Do you want to go invest in a company that your kids buy shit like this:

. . .or any other dog shit meme of the day.

Wake up - there are too many of these meme stocks - this is not a $GME situation in regards to the meme's floating around.

They are dividing and conquering you.

You can try to time it and catch a falling knife, but these memes will burn most of you in the end.

It's your money, do with it as you please and I hope you make a lot.

I'm putting my money on a fucking thoroughbred in $CLF.

Have fun at the dog races, while $CLF wins the Kentucky Derby.

Good luck and do your own research.

1623353262.0,$WISH and Amazon Buyout Offer in 2015,"Remember Amazon in 2015 had offered $10 billion in cash for Wish — and Wish walked. 

 In December 2020, WISH had an IPO and price was set as $24/ share or $15 billion in market value. 

Today in 2021, WISH is more fundamentally stronger and popular. Wish e-commerce app is most downloaded app in the world for last three consecutive years.

Revenues are up 75% and total revenue expected in 2021 is $3.2 billion.

However, current market value of the company is just around $6 billion and it has $2 billion in cash i.e. Enterprise Value (EV) today is only approx. $4 billion.

Compared to 2015, WISH is much more fundamentally stronger, popular and growing faster but valued at ($4 billion EV) which is way less that Amazon offered in 2015 (i.e. $10 billion)? 

Short sellers in this stock are just greedy!!! driving  down the stock price to ridiculous level.

Based on my personal opinion you should hold on to your stock as they are valued multiple times than reflected in the current stock price.",323,0,nww6d5,aaakansha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nww6d5/wish_and_amazon_buyout_offer_in_2015/,False,68
1623323386.0,BlackBerry BB DD - Canada and Facebook Settlement,"# This is not a financial advice. Don't be stupid.

# Canada:

It might surprise you but BB is a Canadian company 🇨🇦 . One thing all Canadian federal parties (LPC, CPC, BQ, NDP, GPC) have in common is ***they heavily support Canadian companies no matter what***. Not only that, people in Canada still reminiscent about BB and their role in Canadian history.

[Here is CEO John Chen at Public Policy Forum in 2019 on why he chose to stay in Canada and the support he got from the federal Canadian Gov. I highly recommend you watch the whole section since it highly speaks of BB's culture. (0:53 - 4:18).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&t=53s)

[Here is starting from the juicy part (1:53 - 4:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&t=113s)

# Facebook Settlement:

[Here is Bloomberg reporting in January 2021 that Facebook and BlackBerry has settled with no further details.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement)

1.	[CEO John Chen confirms their licensing negotiation involves the complete sale of the majority of BB's portfolio (@34:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&t=2088s)

`Transcript:`

`Michael Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity Group -- Analyst`

`... Should you complete the sale, just the vast majority of your portfolio and you won't have any licensing revenue going forward? ...`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio.`

&#x200B;

2) [Deal involves one huge payment followed by a tail revenue and keeping IVY and QNX(36:53 - 38:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&t=2213s)

`Transcript:`

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Hi, John. Just a question about how you're hoping to structure the deal for the patent sale. Should we expect ongoing royalties to come from, maybe you get a portion of the licensing fees that you are -- that the buyer will take or is this more of a one-time deal?`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There is a majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on. I can't give you the details of this, but for multiple number of years.`

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Okay, now you mentioned in the past that you've had offers for the entire portfolio. So what's different now that's making you consider selling it.`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There re two reasons. Number one is, I really think it is a wrong thing to sell the entire portfolio because there is so much of our -- we have an ongoing business in cybersecurity and an ongoing business in BTS which of course includes IVY and QNX. I think selling those portfolio will be extremely unwise for the company and for the shareholders.`

&#x200B;

3) [Tail revenue is up to SEVEN years (@47:31).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&t=2851s)

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.`

&#x200B;

All of this is huge. It shows that:

1.	BB is in the upper position in negotiation by the fact that Facebook is willing to buy a majority of BB's patents upright to avoid trial
2.	BB is in the position to negotiate up to 7 years of licensing revenue after their sale.
3.	BB has a clear business plan post sale.

1623348641.0,"GME to AMC and BB last week: ‘Ladies go first!’ GME soon: ‘Hold my beer, bitches!’","Greetings, honourable intellectually gifted fellow WSB participants. It’s crayons drawing Roman here, and this time I brought you a fascinating technical thesis I would like to hear your opinion about!

Important notice to be made: this is a motherfucking super duper risky play, and you will most definitely lose a lot of money, if not all, if you follow it, especially via FDs. So don’t fucking follow it, you fucking donkey! Rather, treat it as a technical hypothesis, or a fun TA brain candy - and tell me what you think, I’d like to gather some sweet retarded feedback.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kjo0vjdoah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c8a2e3bcc54035412afdb6ea5cba9d21f91e31c

Without further ado, let’s get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC’s price action after the breakout. \[Juicy is what juicy does\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\_looking\_juicy\_next\_resistance\_targets\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.

As you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it’s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. 

So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.

Another thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.

And the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).

Overall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?

Love you and fuck you with all of my heart,

Roman, aka TA degenerate.

Oh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:

1623345478.0,WISH - personal DD - Fair price share target $20 - $40/share.,"# How it started

# On 6/9 I was alerted to WISH, before this I had never heard of this company 

* After skimming the latest 10-Q and 10-K I found no obvious red flags. 
   * The company is generating decent Revenue $2.5B from latest 10-K, and plowing it all into marketing and product development as per latest 10-Q. 
      * Music to a growth investor’s ears
* Considered that WISH IPO on December 16th 2020 and started to trade from $20 to an all time high of $32.85 February 1st 2021 
* Pulled the trigger on a small amount on 6/9
   * Stock dipped purchased some more 
      * Stock dipped purchased some more 
      * Repeated until full retard attrition mode reached
      * Averaged priced $11.20 on 6/9 with ballz deep # of shares

That night started to dig deeper into the company ...

# Wish App 

Best analogy I could come up for the Wish iPhone mobile app is a cross between Amazon app with regards to experience and price levels and delivery times that of Alibaba.

Personally, I use Amazon Prime for all online shopping. Unless it’s a hard-to-get item, then I got to E-Bay maybe Etsy or purchase directly from the vendor’s site. If I need volume, I will use Alibaba (but it’s a f#$%ing hassle to deal with import tax and delivery on heavy items). I have yet to try Ali Express. 

Because I have never heard of Wish until now, I immediately installed the app and by the end of the night sent an invite code to 3 people and purchased roughly $184 of stuff I wanted to get. 

The app has a nice flow and it upsells using promo codes and add-hoc discounts. Very addictive experience, perfect for a retarded consumer such as myself. That night I ended up with: 

* Green Point Laser that could start a fire $12.00 ship cost $4
* 100 pc drill bit set $8.64 ship cost $11.50
* 3 pc ex drill set $5.26 ship cost $11.50 
* 46 pc repair tools/socket wrench $18.23 ship cost $1.00
* 50 pc titanium drill bit set $9.00 ship cost $3.00
* Blue tooth mini ear buds $1.89 ship cost $1.00
* 7 Inch Tablet with Quad core $0.50 (new) ship cost $3.65 (how the F#$%\^ is that so low, must see it to believe it)
* Car Cellphone Charger $18.21 ship cost $3.65
* Tactical flash light $8.55 ship cost $11.50
* 20x50 HiDef Wide Angle Binoculars $39.00 ship cost $11.50 ( $1400 MSRP  ... have to see it to believe it)
* Automotive Error code reader $0.50 (ffs @ 0.50 cents I just bought it to see what its like) ship cost $0.75
* Polarized sun glasses (gift at join) ship cost: $1.00

So now I wait for it all to arrive. Some of the things are shipped from USA and labeled as such and many other things will take more time as they come from Gina et all (similar to E-Bay and Alibaba) 

I was blown away at how cheap and easy it was to place the order. Shipping didn’t make sense for some of the things, but the price offset that. 

The feeling I had was similar to when I walked into a Walmart store for the first time. The only thing nagging me is that most of the things I bought from Walmart either broke or I threw away so I have a full expectation of the same for the above-mentioned products, but this is not the point and I digress.

**If the above items arrive as described, Wish is my new go to online shopping.**  
 

# Financial Consideration

Amazon and Alibaba are obvious competitors. Because Wish is relatively new it’s not turning a profit. However, the steady Revenue and user base growth over-compensates this in my opinion.

Based on [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/) I am expecting **2021 Revenue to be around $3.65B** based on historic values

&#x200B;

WISH user base has a very solid growth

&#x200B;

# Based on finance.yahoo.com stats as of 6/10/2021:

* **AMAZON Profitability**
   * Profit Margin 6.42% 
   * Price to Sales 4.01  
* **BABA Profitability**
   * Profit Margin 20.99% 
   * Price to Sales 5.24  
* WISH **Profitability**
   * **Profit Margin -28.09%**
   * **Price to Sales 2.5** 

I personally value stock on how much Revenue it could generate.

So, given my estimated revenue for 2021 of $3.65B and WISH’s price of $10.79 as of 6/10/2021 it is roughly 2X-3X undervalued against the competitors. Making Fair Value of the stock, in my opinion, $20 - $40 with market cap at around $30B +/- $10B which aligns with original valuation the founders wanted, and only half of what it IPO at.

# All of this does not take into account accumulating high Short Interest!

# In Conclusion: Riding WISH to its Fair market price of $20-$40, then will see.

1623375522.0,WKHS and shorts killing the company,"WKHS and ridiculously high daily short volume

Hi apes, 
Today, I’ve noticed some sketchy trends in WKHS daily % of volume shorted, which is that more than half of daily stock volume is shorted everyday. Here’s some data:
More is available at: nakedshortreport.com/company/WKHS

Jun 04 - 61.36% of volume shorted
Jun 07 - 56.93% of volume shorted 
Jun 08 - 56.12% of volume shorted

I’m sharing this not because I want to go to the moon (although that would be nice), but to show the greed that shorts display on this stock, which results in the company being threatened to go out of business. WKHS is a startup US company with revolutionary products such as drone delivery and electric trucks and those shorts are killing this gem.

Since WKHS is down more than 10% today, shorting restriction rule is going to be applied tomorrow, which means it can’t be shorted. In my opinion it’s a perfect chance to strike back at shorts and make them cover to save this company and punish shorts.

Disclosure: I own 108 shares at 13.80 average and doing my part.

1623359459.0,What’s going on with RKT? It’s time to enter a position. Rocket Auto and Rocket Homes is legit.,"I’ve been following since IPO and I’m very familiar with how it trades. I’m not here to convince anybody to buy and I’m not here to say other stocks suck. Go ahead and promote your stock I don’t give a shit. I’m simply stating what I believe is going to bare investors fruit soon. Great part is you don’t have to hold through all the bullshit manipulation to capitalize.

Before diving in to why I think RKT is a huge buy right now there’s something that should be discussed before reading this.

All these “meme stocks” are posted when the stock is already up 50%. Your chances of losing money is very high when you buy those levels. The sub needs to understand how to buy low and sell high even though people pride themselves on losing money for some reason. I don’t think RKT is a meme stock to be honest…and fuck that term. Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn’t mean it’s a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy’s, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down, but yolloing OTM contracts on high volatility at all time highs it’s just throwing your money in the garbage. If you think that’s cool then fine -  do what you want I don’t give a shit, but you’re not helping anybody but hedge funds. 

RKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up.

The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD’s for sources and more info. 

Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn’t go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won’t allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. 

I believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. 

Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don’t know about you but I don’t get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won’t be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It’s a totally different city now I have recently been there.

One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn’t be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won’t make it work because if it’s one thing they know how to do it’s to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you’ll see commercials over and over again and eventually you’ll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they’ll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they’ll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don’t need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail.

The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it’s still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren’t stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up.

If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don’t know how you’ll ever be convinced. That is not what they’re doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they’ll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. 

Companies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages. Except it’s very difficult field to just enter. No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it. Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech, He was Dan Gilbert’s roommate in college at law school. He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages, this is when the company was private. After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn’t actually be able to be successful due to their business model. RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time. They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue, thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing.

Position:  2600 shares @ 17.86 and 100 40.89s for 2023. I also have additional calls but I don’t really like giving that information out because I’m a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit.

This is not advice I’m just stating the facts. If you’re looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months. I believe by 2023 it’ll be over 150 a share. I would buying share until iv dies down on options.

Another thing I want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now. I wonder why. 

TLDR: rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well-known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice. This is not a mortgage play this is a value play. Don’t ever listen to any articles to justify price action that’s for the sheep. It just makes sense. All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you’ll just see green moving forward. Below $20 a share won’t be seen after September ever again imo.

Edit: typos

Edit 2: if you want to invest in a mortgage company then sure invest in both RKT and United whatever the fuck. If you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and 194th richest company on Fortune 500 then invest in RKT. Idk about you but mortgages are boring. I like innovation. I like a company that’s ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers. The best part is, it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play 30 years of catch-up at Rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at RKT. 60 hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped.",185,0,nwymz6,Thorbeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwymz6/whats_going_on_with_rkt_its_time_to_enter_a/,False,71
1623378746.0,WKHS - Buy the Rumor USPS One More Time? USPS $12 Billion !!!,"It is deju vu all over again. It is June and the horse is running just like it did 12 months ago when it went from penny stock to over $20 faster than Man O' War ever could run. Today we have a more mature company with over 8,000 trucks on back order and a drone unit that has tested succesufuly 45 out 45 times. That makes me think at $2 Billion which it trades at is already a value to its peers (NKLA $7 Billion Market Cap - Arrival $11 Billion - and Rivian rumored to IPO at $70 Billion).

The big honey pot, of course, was always the USPS deal which was shockingly given to Osh Kosh Defense in a deal that has drawn heavy scruntiy. If you read the press release closely, you notice that OSK has only been awarded $450 million of the deal so far and even more oddly it is a rendering of a truck that has never been tested. Qualified bidders all put vehicles through rigirous USPS testing in various terrain, climate and durabity in the finalist stage. USPS picked a rendering after a half decade of making companies go through all the hoops and ladders. There were three finalist. Workhorse Group, OSK, and Morgan Olson who was partnered with Turkish company Karsan who had a hybrid vehicle that was bypassed.

A month ago, Workhorse announced a partnership deal with a new subsidary of Olson called EAVX. During the earnings call the day of the announcement, Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes kept reffering to a ""Next Generation Delievery Vehicle"" the two companies were working together on but didn't expand much further on the product. It was intersting terminology as the USPS contract was for a ""Next Generation Delievery Vehicle"". Morgan Olson has been working on USPS trucks for four decades and took over Grumman who did the USPS trucks currently in use you see today.

Today it was announced that the infrastructure bill has been agreed to and in that bill there was an allotment for $12 Billion for USPS to transition to EVs. Were these two companies told to partner to come up with parts that then could be brought to OSK to do final assembly? Workhorse would provide the chassis, Olson would do the frame, and OSK would mesh the two together. It is definetly a possibilty.

OSK stated in their SEC filing in the fall that they were behind in EV development so could use a partner if USPS wants to transition to a full EV fleet now that the funds are available for them in this bill. It would also play well in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan (all battleground states) getting a piece of a giant government contract and employ thousands of workers in those battleground states.

1623385190.0,$TX DD - Ternium It Up - Latin America’s Balls of Steel,"TL;DR: Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it’s at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel shorting) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a “fuck you, pay me” attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company.

# This week was crazy. Do you want to make more money? Are you tired of endless shart sqioizle squirt trash comments? Do your wives have DDs?

**If any of these apply to you, then keep reading.**

\*\*CLF is still primed and ready to launch, but let me introduce you to his Mexican brother $TX (Ternium).\*\*

# Where and what the fuck is TX?

Down in the lands of strippers, cocaine and cartels, TX produces flat steel and uses its own version of cocaine, coal coke.  Ternium is Latin America’s largest producer of flat steel and makes **more than all of Yanksteel (American Steel) combined**.

Consumer goods production has continued to increase in Mexico over the past 25 years with post-corona recovery already in play.

[Mexico is back in business](https://preview.redd.it/efynva3dbk471.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3c4cc4c518c61343e06abb071618d12e1070ce)

# Ternium & Tech:

[Both methods EAF and BF allow for multilevel steel production for all the lambos and shit that you want.](https://preview.redd.it/drxs6s5gbk471.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9c949787566f94d7264c198445c58309260aaa)

TX takes advantage of more technologically advanced steel production methods that a lot of other companies including Yanksteel. After shamelessly stealing this image from u/JayArlington we can see a few different things. Using Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) **and** Blast Furnaces, TX maximizes steel production output. EAFs use scrap metal while Blast Furnaces directly cook iron ore to make steel that’s harder than your dicks when you see a “sHarT sQuEeZe” post.

Additionally, TX can be considered vertically integrated as they have a business dedicated to iron ore mining and production of something called Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), which can also be used in EAFs. The minimal waste of resources and maximized production is key to Ternium beating much of the steel industry.

Every single item you use from lambos, appliances, home goods, and even electronics need this steel.We can see the effects of inflation and these rising prices as used cars are somehow appreciating in value and construction costs are going vertical.

# Steel Goes BRRRRR:

As you know, the steel industry is booming right now. HRC futures prices (Hot Rolled Coils) are through the roof, with nearly every month through 2022 above $1000, a **50% increase** within the past 6 months. Because of both Buyden’s infrastructure talks and sustained global demand as China plays games with exports and imports, the steel industry **IS THE BEST SECTOR** from an inflationary and money making machine standpoint. Inflation is **not** transitory as JPOW keeps lying to us, but will have long term consequences as the money printer continues to go brrr too.

TX exports across the globe and operates specifically in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Southern U.S.

**For the degenerates who actually use their brain cells, $TX is currently immune to tariffs.** The Section 232 tariffs the U.S. placed on steel do not apply to the rest of North America aka Mexico and Canada. This means that all the steel produced there can be sold at full premium.

If $TX is smart and follows through with opening an actual plant in the U.S. to pair with its U.S. operations, this would be in their best interest. As China continues to export less steel (with a potential export tax) and massive infrastructure plans about to be signed in place, $TX has a golden opportunity to produce massive steel dildos of profits.

# Financials:

**$TX was basically immune to coronavirus. You could give this bitch the Indian triple variant and it would still pump out profits like there’s no tomorrow.**

Argentina and Brazil continued to have strong construction and home demands, and as a result, in Q1 of 2021, Ternium had an **EPS of $3.07, a 45% increase from the previous quarter, beating estimates by 36%.** Just like every other steel company, TX is taking the “fuck you, pay me” approach. As steel prices continue to rise, so does TX’s offering of flat steel. It’s like an infinite tendie machine.

\##**Analyst ANALysis:**

*“$TX (Ternium S.A.) has a Q2 2021 EPS estimate of $3.42 (only a slight increase over their Q1 $3.07 EPS number). This appears absurdly low which will mean another high percentage beat by $TX as analysts are surprised once again.”*  \- u/BlueWolf1983

Using some of his mathemagical skills, he determined that half of their Q2 sales should be based on previous Q1 prices. That appears to be somewhere in the $1200s. Assuming a Q1 2021 price of $1210 and an average Q2 2021 spot price of $1490, this would be a price of **$1,350 per ton**.

Again, based on these prices, he then calculated the following:

*“In the following chart, I've further added their cost per ton by taking the cost of their steel sales in Q1 of 2020 and dividing it by their total steel shipments. As they mentioned input costs would marginally increase, I've given that roughly a flat 5% 10% input cost increase. As on their Q2 call they mentioned input price increases lag due to existing inventory + reserves and as they mine their own ore, that should be sufficient.”*

&#x200B;

|Country|Shipments (in thousands of tons )|Q2 2021 Estimated Ton Price|Q2 2021 Cost Per Ton Estimate|Profit Per Ton|Total Profit (in Millions)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mexico|1699|$1,350|$770|$580|$985.42|
|Southern Region|680.8|$1,210|$770|$440|$299.56|
|Other Markets|687.7|$1,100|$770|$330|$226.94|

*It appears they sell electricity in Mexico and Brazil as well. This is way too hard to try to figure out a Q2 estimate for. As this seems to range between 44M and 59M in profits for them, we will just add 50M to get a new total profit of:* ***$1,566.92M.***

Doing more math that went slightly over my head, the final EPS calculated should be: $**4.48.**

**This is all based on data approximately 1 month old, which means the EPS would likely be higher.** **From a conservative standpoint, this is another 35% beat of the previous quarter’s EPS.**

# Mega Shart Interest Stats:

**Currently, the shart interest on TX is ranging around 15%.** In the past month alone, the number of shares sharted increased by about 10%.

[Shart Volume Graph](https://preview.redd.it/72urus3obk471.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba20440bab38aff74777d66c2f4274ee8e572319)

# Here’s where things get interesting with the price action:

HOW is it that a company that is making **TRIPLE PROFITS** over the past 3 months due to increasing HRC prices, STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN MARCH. When earnings come out, $TX will blow through the roof and rest at its fair price of $55. But even now, it should be worth **ATLEAST** $42 at a minimum.

https://preview.redd.it/ctkmseesbk471.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=674ff4dd914b7bbbbc46043e02f0b73381833881

# AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS TO BUY:

[Citadel sCheMiNg](https://preview.redd.it/44h0yditbk471.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5ae6d643514394671fb62a8bd2cb70f78b612)

**Citadel has been placing short positions on $TX since May,** which is the exact same time its price began to be suppressed. This isn’t some conspiracy or anything, just basing it on facts.

# 🌈🐻 Case:

The one thing I can see affecting profits is if cartels manage to take over the national government and seize control of the manufacturing industry. During the elections this past week, which also contributed to Mexican company stocks taking a dive, a lot of cartels were on assassination sprees.The political turmoil in Mexico could causes instability in the supply chain in the short-term. I don’t see this as a problem considering everyone needs steel and that cartels can’t drive the price downv just through political shenanigans.

# Conclusion:

# Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it’s at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a “fuck you, pay me” attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company.

My Positions:

**10 contracts of 8/20 50C**

I will be averaging in with about 50 more contracts of the September 45Cs too.

Thanks to u/JayArlington and u/Bluewolf1983 for data and inferences made throughout this post.

Thanks to u/Dan_inKuwait for helping get this approved.

Ok, so now I hope most of you know why we have seen the action we have on $CLF.

In past DD's and most recently in LG's revised guidance, we know that HRC will be averaging much more than is currently baked in:

The Company’s forecast includes the following expectations:

* First-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA* of approximately $500 million

* Second-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA* of approximately $1.2 billion

* Full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA* of approximately $3.5 billion

The full-year expectation is based on current contractual business and the assumption that the US HRC price averages $975 per net ton for the remainder of the year.

###**$975 per net ton!**

Maybe, $975 per 6/10 of a ton.

My prediction is $1,200 minimum and remember, we will start to realize those profits in Q2 and especially Q3.

Why this company is being shorted is beyond lunacy, it's pure greed and they think they can hammer a boomer stock that no one cares about.

Until yesterday when it made the headlines as the NEW MEME stock.

Well, this stock is not a meme, its actually a fucking stud that is run by a bigger fucking stud named LG.

If you were going to bet on 5 CEO's today for me they would be:

Jeff Bezos

Tim Cook

Elon Musk

Lisa Su

Lourenco Goncalves

Why do I put LG in the pantheon of these titans?

Two reasons:

1. They all know their business cold.
2. They are all transformational leaders with vision.
If you don't know who LG is - take some time to read up on him and watch his YouTube videos.

He oozes strong leadership, knowledge and passion.

He's what I call a ""foxhole guy"", meaning if I went to war, I'd want him in my foxhole.
