We went on a world tour, building fuckboy in every new r/place expansion. Countless wars, alliances, and betrayals. New friends, new enemies, and new inside jokes. 

Let's keep Fuckboy in tiptop shape until the final picture. 

For everyone who participated alongside us, reply to this comment with a screenshot of your name placing a pixel (of the correct colour!!) on Fuckboy.

Either I, u/simplevice, or u/cashflow_ will hook you up with some 🅿️ixel 🅿️ushing flair. (Or custom flair, if you think of something witty and r/place related)]","[i3d2c1b,

Since this is a discussion, let's discuss the hypothetical entry.  The time frame you discuss is long, so sensitivity is relatively low, but buying OTM calls seems inconsistent with a long-term play.  Implied movements in price do not mean we should take things entirely for granted.  Fickle forces are indeed at work in the market, no matter which way it swings.   

Is there a rationale for choosing an OTM strike beyond the implied price increase and/or probability of a greater profit percentage?  Would it not be wiser to select an ATM/ITM strike?  Is safeguarding with a strangle appropriate?]","[i3d6oho, Yes.

The value you see is the total nominal value that the options *control*. If you had one SPY call and had to report it, you'd put $45,500 in your report.

So, first point of order, the value reported DOES NOT correspond to any value of the options held. Only the value of the controlled underlying.

Second point, note that in the above I didn't even mention strike or expiration. That's because for the 13F/G, those DO NOT MATTER AND ARE NOT REPORTED

So for all we know, those could be $480 calls or $1200 calls. Expiring next Friday or in two years. Who knows

I cannot know what is the exact thing going on here, but my hunch is Susquehanna is very short SPY (short positions don't need to be reported usually) and they are holding a lot of way OTM calls as a hedge to satisfy the risk department requirements]","[i3koqnf, Squeeze my nuts]","[i3gpssm, Bullish]","[i3d3aod, So now we’ve stooped to CatDog….

BBBY was suppose to complete the buy back in February but never announced anything.  Like I said, last time they announced on the peak and I suspect they may announce again on Tuesday the 5th.

Harker is a dove in my view (based on his recent interviews), so it'll be interesting to see what he says & if he's hawkish. 

More sanctions = more supply chain issues & inflation. The Ukraine/Russia situation seems to be getting worse overall, not better. The recent events around Kyiv seems to have caused an increase in inflammatory rhetoric & has likely made peace negotiations more contentious.

I could see one of a few different scenarios playing out. If Harker & FOMC minutes are dovish, we maybe get a green day. Sanctions are the fly in the ointment.

It was that they took all the cash collateral they received and plowed it into... You guessed it, high-yield subprime mortgage bonds. 

""Companies that lend securities usually take that cash collateral and invest it in something short term and relatively safe. But AIG invested heavily in high-yield—and high-risk—assets. This included assets backed by subprime residential mortgage loans.""

""The borrowers of a security can typically terminate the transaction at any time by returning the security to the lender and getting their collateral back. But since AIG had invested primarily in longer-term assets with liquidity that could vary substantially in the short term, returning cash collateral on short notice was not so easy.""

So the issue wants that they lent shares. The issue is they took all the cash collateral they received from the share loans and put it in the exact asset class that collapsed in underlying value in 2008. 

I also want to point out that the worst case of MOASS happening and the borrowers not being able to locate shares and going bust still means the lending fund just keeps the cash collateral. It would in the absolutely worst case mean they miss the upside but wouldn't lead to liquidity/solvency issues like AIG had]","[i3hinru, That’s the Tesla story replayed with another company that starts with a T]","[i3miq5i, Wow]","[i3ftyfj, ok, now his last haircut looks reasonable]","[i3j4rsf, Why can’t the fed keep their damn mouth’s shut!!!]","[i3jjgtf,  shorting twitter]",,"[i3idbdh, Using TA to predict fundamentals price action.

Plummeting returns at the end of 2021 effectively put an end to the past year’s IPO boom, and coupled with the escalating war in Europe, issuance ground to a halt in late February. Only seven IPOs raised more than $50 million, led by TPG’s billion-dollar deal, which alone accounted for nearly half of proceeds. A majority of activity came from micro-caps, which caused the median deal size to fall to $27 million, its lowest level in at least two decades. IPOs averaged a 28% return, driven by explosive first-day pops from volatile small issuers and decent returns from larger ones. The Renaissance IPO Index had its worst quarter since 2011 with a 24% drop, well below the S&P 500’s loss. The SPAC market deflated, with a 66% drop in pricings from the 4Q21 and a rise in IPO withdrawals, redemption rates, and merger terminations. The near-term outlook for the IPO market is foggy heading into the second quarter, though one thing is clear: recent IPO returns and risk appetite will need to rebound before activity resumes. Still, many private companies are eyeing 2022 IPOs, and there are plenty of candidates in the pipeline ready to come to market once conditions improve.”]","[i32l686, Is the guy wearing the womans shirt the same guy from the HBO show Succession?]",,"[i38qxbi, Follow me not to learn how to turn 100 into 120k and 120k into -150k!]","[i2zpilg, Fantastic]","[i39bzvz, ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)]","[i32zmf9, What’s the ticker on this obviously public traded company?.]","[i33ui8v, Hey, if you haven't already, please reply to this comment with your positions and what led you to enter or exit them!

The fact that every tech company decided around the same time to just ignore the false positive issue in favor of lowering false negative rates chasing 100% compliance is gonna byte them in the ass once somebody makes a platform championing freedom of expression but not freedom of hate.

There is a market there.

Without to much exception the day before will not price as high as a few days before. Most recent example was nio. I got my ER calls when it was 14. I sold most of them for 600% a few days before held the rest till the day before ER and even tho the price was higher the greeks had shifted to bone all the yolos so my calls were worth less at a higher price.

The GME naked short selling is of course a huge example of this, and it’s amazing what a movement and DRS action all Apes here are accomplishing. 

It’s literally writing financial reform and history as we go all through this (in fact ‘disgusting’) adventure. 

This being said, there are DAILY examples of blatant corruption and manipulation on Wall Street in front of everybody’s eyes,… and nobody seems to give a shit about it. 

Because,…., how the hell is it even possible that ( by definition corrupt and money-printing) BANKS, which all own huge positions in the biggest stocks, are ENTITLED to give their RATINGS & OPINIONS about these same stocks they own (or want to own)??????!!!!

Think about it…. How can this even be allowed??

‘Oh, it’s to inform and ‘help’ the illiterate retail investors’ …. RIGHT!

Of course NOT!!!

It’s the biggest manipulation and corruption in front of our eyes, on a daily basis brought to us by ‘bought’ or corrupted Media (TV, Newspapers, social media,…)

It’s EVERYWHERE and we can’t even escape from it. 

And it goes on as long as the markets exist, in all parts of the world. 

But this is NOT NORMAL!!!!!

This is pure ILLEGAL, CRIMINAL activities on a daily basis. It’s that simple. 

When ‘insider trading’ is illegal,…

what then about this Mega Corrupt, Planned Mass-Manipulation trading?????!

Any private company or organization, who owns positions in stocks, should just…..

KEEP THEIR DIRTY, CRIMINAL, CORRUPT MOUTH CLOSED and should be prosecuted whenever direct or indirect they vomit their manipulative opinion!!! (With huge $$$ fines, closure of business and effective prison time as a direct consequence of their actions. )


That’s how simple it should be. 

Madoff was a pussy in comparison to these mega, criminal organizations called…. BANKS!!

Their CEO’s and boards are nothing more than Capo’s of well organized criminal organizations, involved in DAILY, high level CRIMES while stealing and corrupting the money and wealth of their own fucking clients and economies!!!

I do not think this is normal and we should NO LONGER accept it. Period. 

We should have a complete financial REVOLUTION!!  

I sincerely hope DeFi is an honest step in this direction. 

Oh, btw, try to go and deposit $10k to your local bank without a decent explication, or try to cash in a few American Eagles,… before you know it, those same criminals have informed the IRS, because…. you are the criminal!!!

While in the same time, they created millions of fake money, derivatives, etc. , naked shorted on a DAILY basis about $500 MILLION shares and manipulated millions of clients to panic-sell the exact shares the corrupt banks are buying up (and vice versa if course) etc. , etc. …..

Right, we are the criminals!!!

Give me a fucking break!!!!!

This is my main motivation to be just a small Ape, along with us all and…

I’ll keep at least 10 stonks until infinity or until this corrupt, criminal, financial system has collapsed and it’s main actors (CEO’s, C-Levels and Boards of banks and SHF’s, talking TV puppets and so-called (corrupt) journalist are behind bars or…

have taken the elevator to the 69th floor, opened the window and….

I’ll push the play button of Van Halen’s favorite song!!

Primarily we do corn, cotton, and soybeans. Our dealer told me 3 weeks ago that cost of fertilize was around $210 per acre(usually around $75-80 per acre in the past). Round-up was just as bad. At first they only guaranteed us 60% of what we had been getting but we got all of our’s reserved now. We are going with some old school methods to avoid using as much roundup. The estimated cost of planting an acre of corn, which includes seed, chemicals, fuel, etc. is around $500!!

In my part of the country, soybean yield avg is around 40 and corn is like 150. Farmers will still use fertilize despite raising costs. You have to or you won’t have much to gather in the fall. All chicken poop is already sold or reserved for someone from every chicken barn around here, which is uncommon. Some farmers are using liquid fertilizers because apparently it’s a little cheaper. We have never done the liquid fertilize.

Fertilize, fuel, and chemicals, specifically, roundup are the biggest differences in estimates. Our estimated bill for everything is projected to nearly triple. (2.6 times higher is what we were told)

I expect prices in commodities to rise throughout the year, which will snowball down to your local grocery store. I think farmers will fill contracts directly after gathering to have the funds to pay the bills because everyone is on edge about everything. Many new farms will end up selling out after this year. If I had to guess when prices would peak, I’d say around summer 2023.

Ten is a number.

If you look at your hands, you'll find that a vast majority of those who also have hands, also have the same count of fingers, which are also called digits.

The correlation is that there are 10 digits - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

This list has a length of 10 (excluding spaces and commas, for those of you in comas).

Therefore, you can create a value out of ten digits. Repeatedly selecting a digit (of the numerical kinds, not of the humanical kind) can allow one to represent a value, including ten (selecting the 1 and 0 digits, respectively).

This value can then be associated with ... well, anything that has a quantitative attribute, such as ... ten digits. Twenty dollars. Thirty shares. Forty pictures of loss porn. Fifty shades of ..

You get the idea.

The GPU-crypto mining frenzy is finally over. Here's a top list of reasons why:  
\- There is generally no real use for cryptocurrency (ethereum in particular) at the moment (except buying drugs and other illegal stuff) because transaction fees are too high and acceptability in the real world is non-existent.  
\- GPUs are not efficient compared to ASIC-Mining hardware because GPUs are primarily designed to run games. ASIC Mining equipment has much higher profitability. Ethereum is the exception and it is highly optimized for GPUs but still companies like innosilicon sell highly optimized ASIC-Miners for Ethereum. The lack of availability of Etherum ASIC-Miners is the only reason GPUs are still being used for Ethereum mining. The constant threat of changing Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake is only targeted at convincing people that the cost of investing in an efficient Ethereum ASIC-Miner is too big of a risk. ASIC miners are much more energy efficient compared to a mining rig with GPUs.  
\- Even when switching to PoS (Proof of Stake) in Summer 2022 it might not save Ethereum prices from continuing to fall. But as mentioned before this will probably not happen anyway because PoS only serves as a threat to prevent people from investing in ASIC mining equipment instead of GPUs.  
\- The video card manufacturers wanted to be part of and profit from the cryptocurrency frenzy and for this reason Ethereum was optimized to run efficiently on GPUs. The fork of Ethereum a few years back was needed to prevent GPU's with 4GB and lower to be obsolete for mining. The DAG (Direct acyclic graph) needs to be in VRAM and if it grows to over 8GB then all GPUs with 8GB or less would not be useable anymore.  
\- Finally everyone is facing the reality of cryptocurrencies meteoric rise in value is coming to an end and the risk in spending tens of thousands in hardware cost with months or even years before break even seems less attractive today.  
\- The only big advantage of GPU mining compared to ASICs has always been the argument that when the hardware becomes unprofitable or obsolete the GPUs could be sold on the market to recuperate costs. If my predictions are correct and the market will be flooded with GPUs in the coming months the price drop might be so huge that even this might be just a big lie invented by the hardware manufacturers to rip customers off. If GPU miners start to panic they might try to get out at any cost no matter how low the used GPU market falls.  
If there is anything to be learned from history then it's the fact that during the 1849 gold rush in California the mining equipment traders were the ones who made the most profit by providing overpriced tools that were much less worth when mining stopped.  
Let's hope everybody learns a lesson in the coming months so there will never be a GPU shortage with overpriced hardware again.  
The more the GPU market crashes the better for the gaming industry because only a crash in GPU prices will prevent people from investing in gaming hardware for GPU-crypto-mining again in the future. The more it hurts the GPU-crypto-miners the more they will think twice about the trade-offs between GPUs and ASICs.

  
TL;DR GPU sales might slow down because of decreased demand from miners in the coming months which might affect profits for nVidia and AMD. Prices for new GPUs might get close to MSRP in the coming months.]",,"[i3ctzc2, Hey, if you haven't already, please reply to this comment with your positions and what led you to enter or exit them!

If you look at the daily I would expect a drop to the $900 - $950 price range before testing the recent highs near $1,115 again.  Obviously speculation but look at Oct. 14 - Nov. 3 as an example... Went up almost $400 from $818 to $1,215 then retraced back to $1,000 in a matter of 4 days.  Took a week to get back up to that $1,200 for a retest but that's a 20% profit if you waited to go long on the 50% retest. 

I expect TSLA to do a similar move on this since we've essentially had 10 green days in a row mostly vertical.

Regardless, I got a feeling this will print some healthy returns for everyone - if I were Veritas, I would up my offer and still capture some fantastic returns on the company, and close this deal. Probably not gonna be $28, because why would they blow their whole load after the first negotiation, but closer to the 23-24 range. Everyone should stay realistic about the price targets. These VC's are stating price targets as if there was no buyout with price levels like 28, 30, 42, etc over the next 3 years. Remember shareholders are likely up 5-10x already after the last 2 years. That's a pretty safe and tasty offer for them to let Veritas buy out now instead of risking their already huge gains.

But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.

That's just not how it works. When you own one share and it is out on loan at the time of the split, your broker credits you for the new share(s) but they are already out on loan along with the original share, whoever actually holds the share got the dividend, but you get credit for the additional share(s) and whoever borrowed them from you has their debt updated to the split number of shares, so instead of owing you one share the borrower owes you the split number. But they aren't forced to return them that day, your shares are still on loan as normal. You still have the right to recall some or all your shares from loan if your broker allows it, but that doesn't happen automatically when it splits. 

You like comparing to Tesla, so lets look at the short interest on Tesla when they split:

You might as well flip a coin.

Also, it's entirely useless when the Fed is changing bond volume, which directly influences bond yields. QE over the past two years brought yields down across the board. The curve started heading towards inversion around the time tapering started, and there's a mechanical reason for that... which means the entire thesis around the yield curve does not apply because the bond yield has less to do with investor sentiment about debt over time and more to do with the volume of bonds on the market and the fact that rising bond volume is depressing bond value further as the yield increases, meaning flight to safety doesn't include bonds right now because bonds are losing money even as the market declines (whereas many dividend stocks and income ETFs remained profitable).

So this yield curve inversion doesn't really mean anything, and the truth is it never really did.

Edit: Because most people on this sub are binary thinkers, I'm not saying we won't have a recession... we very well may, but the yield curve mechanically does not mean what the theory behind curve inversion suggests right now.

It will be 7 or 8 strikes out of the money.   

Example if Spy is at 420 and I buy a 40dte and 430 strike at .40 .  When the 431 strike is at .50 or more I will sell it.  Get my money back plus a small gain and keep till expire with a dollar spread.  Then buy a 432 and repeat.  Usually can set up a nice ladder on both sides.  Depending on the trends.

Zuckerbergs cack handed (extremely generous) handling of META advertising aside VR is such a great fit for social media, it's the natural conclusion of the fakery, gossip, flirting and marketplace that social media represents. The key is making a realistic world on a non-intrusive device, someone is going to do it and it'll change the world. It'll be an even more shit world but it'll make whoever nails it countless billions. Vr social media - you don't have to imagine it because it'll be here within five years. If and when they can make VR devices that are functionally similar to glasses everyone will be onboard within five years. It's be exactly like the smartphone explosion. 

I like FB as an investment because they make ridiculous revenue and profit. I don't and never have used FB because social media is dogshit and I hate people. My feelings about a company have fuck all to do with my investments. FB might be a bad investment but it's not a bad investment because zoomers think it's lame or because I'm an anti social autist.

Edit - tik tok is literally just short videos (although I'm sure it's been tuned with the backing of algorithmic data and psychologists to keep people endlessly scrolling and watching), it's hardly a fucking breakthrough in technology or entertainment. It's popular because the Chinese government pushed it incredibly hard (IE threw uncountable sums of money at it) and uses it as its own cultural export/control. The point is that it succeeded through brute force, a bunch of Chinese boomers used analytics, millennial labour, and fuck tons of money to appeal to kids.

This combined with all of the additional revenue they'll make from knee pad sales would allow for the opening of multiple new Wendy's locations, each equipped with at least 3 dumpsters.

1. A broker dealer isn’t just a bank like you mentioned above, while the large banks are broker dealers as part of an entity in the other bank (do some research into the repeal of a Glass Steagal to understand how “banks” are actually set up or better yet read a set of fucking financials, start with JPM’s)
2. The “broker dealers” you listed with the largest exposure to the short GME exposure are actually custodians and/or prime brokers, which is NOT the same thing as a broker dealer. While they might be at the end of a trade which is failing, it is most likely due to a small shittty broker which there are hundreds of globally that is insufficient to deliver. 

I won’t read much beyond the first few paragraphs where you absolutely couldn’t be anymore wrong on broker dealers and how trade work with custodians and PBs. 

Another point to educate yourself on is rehypothecation, in which prime brokers can lend what ever the fuck securities they want to the street to cover insufficient share delivery elsewhere. Perfectly legal and is called financing your portfolio for a Fund and called managing risk and exposure for an entity such as a prime. 

Do some research before posting for fucks sake I am tired of this bull shit where everyone thinks they fucking know everything about how this works and yes it’s my fucking job.

So your entire premise comes down to these funds being exposed if or when MOASS occurs, otherwise they're perfectly fine, right? So if MOASS never happens, then there's no risk.  

And do you think that the risk management department at these companies, who's entire job is the calculate and assess the risk of their positions, have considered MOASS as a possible risk? And what conclusion did they reach when they assessed this risk? Since they're still holding the positions and lending the shares, I can only assume one conclusion was made, which is that MOASS isn't really a risk.

History is littered with battles and wars where defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory by those on the winning side, as it is also filled with unlikely victories snatched from the jaws of defeat by the losing side.

One moment Gustavus Adolphus is kicking ass and the other his bodyguards lose their nerves and abandon him during battle and he replies when asked who he is ""I was the king of Sweden"" before being fatally shot....

One moment everyone is in awe of The Spanish Tercio's and believes them invincible, and the next they are beaten in battle by De Condé.

One moment everyone is in awe of ""Apes"" on WSB the next they are being hammered and mocked relentlessly as people demand to see their loss porn. 

And on the other hand one moment apes are relentlessly mocked for their stupidity and the next apes are posting gain porn and the mockers have to endure this and put their memes back in the closet....

we'll see how it goes. June, when the annual meeting and vote for the stock dividend is, is still some time away. 

Until then I've seen myself go +97% and I've seen myself go down -70% and back up again and back down and back up again. I've become strangely apathetic to being in the red, although green wakes up something primal in me, not being able to sit still and singing and dancing in the house and pestering my father and sister who keep telling me to take my gains But my inner voice constantly stopping me from taking profit because ""I'll regret not waiting and taking an even higher profit"" to then see it go down and thinking hm ""can't take my profits now since i was higher once"" and i shouldn't take a profit before I'm at least at that price again or I'll be angry at myself every day for the rest of my life because I could have had more. 

Losing everything doesn't matter all that much since I never had that much anyway,but the thought of getting less than I potentially could have drives me insane and keeps me awake at night. I sold my shares in MDXhealth about 5 or 6 years ago only to see them going higher a month later at the time and it still drives me crazy. And I only sold because my wife was complaining about something money related and I assumed she meant I was supposed to do something about it so I sold my shares gave her the money and asked her to stop complaining and blaming me. Turns out she was just complaining to complain and wasn't expecting anything from me and wasn't blaming me for anything. Which is weird? Why say anything negative to me if you don't expect me to do something? And if you don't consider me the source of the negativity?

Anyway I'll probably see some red again and some green again and then some more red again. it doesn't really matter, I'm going to get free shares that I can convert in to money if needed without having to touch my original 100 shares. 

yes it's a pitiful amount, but it represents all my savings. I joined this place after fomoing into gme hoping the 5k is not a meme crowd was on to something and being able to making enough money to buy a new motherboard, cpu and gpu. 

Bought 10 shares at the time for around 270€ or 300 USD, averaged down when I got a refund for a cruise that was canceled due to covid and that I had saved 2 years for. Now have 100 shares at an average of say 135€ or 150 USD) My wife recently bought 20 shares during what we thought was the dip at I think 96€ or 103 USD per share with what was left when she inherited some money from her mother passing away and after paying the funeral costs.

Hedge funds can ride us for now, but the stock's been beaten down harder, it was almost like the Romans at Trasimene at a certain point. so things don't look all too bad right now.

GME is pretty easy to borrow now.  When the dividend hits, shorts will have to borrow more shares for the dividend.  But the dividend will increase the shares available to be borrowed by the same amount.  Their broker will handle the borrow for them automatically.  If GME is slow to actually deliver the dividend shares there could be some buy-in pressure if there is not enough available to cover the dividend for a few days.  But that usually doesn't happen with larger companies.  

There are reasons to speculate GME could move higher, but the mechanics of the dividend is not one of them.

>When a stock split is announced, companies often describe it as a one time special stock dividend. This is not to be confused with a quarterly cash dividend, and simply means the company will carry out the stock split by issuing additional shares to shareholders.

You know: ""Profit is an opinion where Cash is a fact!"".

Used to work in the #2 Internet company in the world years ago...they had so many users, they literally didn't give a shit at all about the advertisers. Eventually they got destroyed by Google, they lost tons of users and had mass layoffs etc. The huge swings up and down were 100% because of the number of users.   


I would like to see them pick up the pace somewhat and let more people on...the pace seems to have slowed recently. I agree with the overall approach of being cautious, but at some point you have to pick up the pace a little.

1. This could continue until August 22nd and technically if the company consents to it it could continue indefinitely based on this clause of the tender offer shown below

""more periods specified by the Offeror (not in excess of 10 Business Days each) but not (without the priorwritten consent of the Company) beyond August 22, 2022 (the “Outside Date”)""

This makes me think that Veritas has the right to continue extending the deadline up until August 22nd and past that point it would require consent from the company. Considering how badly they botched this sale I could see a world where they would drag this out until shareholders grow tired of the management team and decide to tender.

2. The fact that the stock is trading right at 21 indicates that the market strongly believes this deal is going to go through. The small breaks it experiences above 21 can most likely be attributed to the outrageous call volume leading to delta hedging. You can argue that the 0.6% tender number we received last week indicates that there is a low likelihood of the deal going through but it is absolutely crucial to notice that the stock did not drop on that news. You could interpret that two ways. One being that the market believes this stock is worth at least 21 but realistically is worth more. Or two that the deal still has a lot of time left in it and we don't know how the much larger shareholders actually feel. My gut says the former is most likely true but again I'm here to spread FUD.

3. There is a side to this story that we retail investors definitely don't have access to. The fact that the acquisition process was so flawed based on out of touch EBITDA information that management should have had a firmer grasp of considering the time of year the deal took place makes me extremely nervous that something is wrong at the management level in this company.

Let’s say they decide to give one extra stock( dividend) for every 50 stocks you own. This would be a 2% dividend. 

For the SHF’s, if they shorted 500 stocks as an example they would have to pay the monetary EQUIVALENT of 20 stocks to the person who bought their 500 stocks(as well the ‘normal’ as the illegal naked stocks they shorted). 

So I do not think (note that I ‘think’ this, meaning I’m not 100% sure), based on what I could find, that a broker is obligated to actually give you an effective stock. Mostly, in those cases, they pay out the monetary equivalent of the stock price in cash. 

Some brokers will allow you to request for the stock-dividend as a stock, however a lot( most) won’t even offer the possibility. 

Conclusion: 

1) First there will be a stock split x3.33 (when approved somewhere in June)

2) later on, GameStop can ( and probably will) announce a stock- dividend

3) Broker decides to actually give you the extra stock- dividend or the monetary equivalent in cash. (In computershare you can stipulate whether you want the cash or the stock, and with some brokers probably too)

4) Stock split should have positive effect on price action ( new interest, fomo, cheaper entry point/share, cheaper options, etc. )

When R.C. And investors are patient until price action takes off, then declares the stock dividend, it means that the SHF’s have to come up with a lot of extra cash to payout the stock-dividend or…. Close out their (illegal naked) short position, which will start the MOASS because then…. Marge will be calling and we’ll get the needed domino effect to make the fucking corrupt House of Cards come down. 

This is how I, with only a few wrinkled brain cells, interpret the situation at hand. 

It’s absolutely great news but….

It ain’t over until the fat lady sings…

Amazon was still ramping up distribution facilities and Elon was balls deep in space X and Tesla. Now, low and behold, the Tesla bot is hitting the market soon. It’s just the start.

So why buy stock specially if you missed the initial run up like in teslas case why not just buy leaps when the stock splits and ride those for a year or two. For one they will be much cheaper since the price has been reduced and you will still make the same amount of money if not more since you can now afford to buy more calls or even shares at that point.

Edit: I should clarify im not saying tesla shares are going to fall in price after the split but they will remain stagnant for a while or they could rocket as the stock would be much more affordable for young investors... but i think some of you are confused as to you making more money when the stock splits.

does any1 see how low the volume/price is on BCH3xl on kucoin (.05) vs the last time “4months ago” Bitcoin was up 60k + ..does any1 see our potential with only 300,000 volume rn & “Bitcoin Miami” coming this week to use/double the influence of an entire city plus all the “social influencers” in the “financial industry”as speakers ?🤔Kinda like what was done to pump ETC when ETH was being pushed so heavily a few months back?🤔But even better seeing the track record/possibility of us pushing it back above $1, with both basically free publicity from the week long event (even maybe throw in a couple hashtags) to influence the social meters & maybe even control “Google trends” for the week🤔🤷🏾‍♀️👁👌🏾!

>On March 1, 2021, the FDIC released fourth quarter results and provided   
an update on the Official Problem Bank List.  While FDIC did not make a   
comment within its press release on the Official Problem Bank List, they  
 provided details in an attachment that listed 44 institutions with   
assets of $170 billion, which was a material increase in assets from the  
 $51 billion of assets listed in the preceding disclosure....  
  
>  
> The last time the Official Problem Bank List had assets this high was   
$174 billion as of September 30, 2013.  Given the decline in the number   
of institutions from last quarter, there is speculation as to what   
institution with assets of about $125 billion was added to the list   
during the quarter...

>On March 10, 2022, the American Banker published an article on the mystery of the large jump in assets.

What I do hope comes from this is Elon is so socially inept he'll say the quiet part out loud of websites should either be entirely liable for everything so the groomers and death threats from Twitter basically cause massive seizures and arrests towards Twitter mods, or states people are in fact people online so you can't be banning them.

Revenues up 9.5B vs non-content related costs up 1.2B, leaving 8.3B over. Content costs only increased 3.8B in that period, which means amount 4.5B improvement in cash flow before changes in working capital. Throw in 1.3B in investing (CAPEX plus acquisitions) as compared to 0.4B and the company is still 3.6B ahead of where it is 2 years ago.

Basically, as long as revenue growth continues it seems the company will quickly turn into a cash printing machine. Now market cap is 166B so whether they achieve the growth necessary to justify that market cap or not is another discussion (like I said not attempting to value NFLX), but I really don't think solvency is a concern here.

HBO is 1/4 of what netflix is charging so everyone can afford hbo and dont need to share passwords. Cable providers even supply a free hbomax account if you get the hbo package which costs around $3 in my country.

And to be honest netflix is fucking up a lot because of their woke agenda regarding gender/race/sexuality. I have nothing against people who are different than the norm, i dont mind seeing them in movies. But come on, put a white straight guy in there from time to time. In my country we dont have a lot of trans people, even gay people are pretty rare so its a bit too much seeing them promoted in every movie. I'm saying this because there are a lot of conservative countries in the world who have tens of millions of paying subscribers to netflix who will be on the verge of cancelling the service because the quality of content dropped significantly once they started pushing woke. Sometimes it feels like netflix are trying to program the minds of people with the content provided, maybe I'm just paranoid...

Why isnt there a Netflix live option? Why havent they either acquired a CNN and maybe even a newspaper on the cheap with their frothy market cap or tried to start there own? Politics and Sports are only thing people watch live nowadays Netflix needs to cater to this, as well as maybe some local weather / news options (dont tell me they cant afford to pay a few people for every decent sized city to cover this given the 7 digits they will burn per episode on a Avatar tv series). I dont know add a 'Netflix cooks' similar to food network with all their cooking shows but catered towards their young urban helpless in the kitchen audience to make meals each episode while being entertained by the charismatic chef. Have it sponsored by Blue Apron or some shit.

&#x200B;

Dont want commercials? Well why not commercialize their products without sacrificing quality of content. You watch an episode of Ozark and think an outfit that a character is wearing looks cool? Why cant I just pause the episode and any piece of apparel that is currently on screen is able to be added to a cart and shipped to your home. Works better with Amazon but dont tell me Netflix cant partner with someone, again have designer brands or companies like Nike also pay for this, and earn money without breaking their commercial pledge.

&#x200B;

Instead of just dropping new shows and movies on our lap build anticipation. Have trailers for things coming out next year (curated based on my streaming tastes of course). Wow that new Stranger Things looks good but I want to see it now! Call it Netflix New or some shit and I pay a premium so my fat ass can get movies and shows ahead of everyone else.

AMC usually moves in the same direction as GME but the % move is never the same. So over a certain time period, owning shares in one will make you more than the other.

However, if we assume both will go to say, $1k, percentage wise, you'd make more with AMC, period. Market cap doesn't matter because these spikes will only be temporary. Not like GME or AMC is going to be worth trillions and keep that price.

Startled, JPow looked up.

There she was Cathie. Looking between his legs. Staring at the printer working in full force. Then moving quickly to look him straight in the eyes.

He didn’t know what was more embarrassing: that she was there with him in the restroom or that he was printing in front of her. She just stood there, watching him.

‘What are you doing here?’ JPow asked, unsure of how to deal with the awkward situation.

‘I thought you wanted to buy me,’ Cathie said, her eyes tearing into him.

A bell was heard in the background, the market just opened up.

Cathie touched his face. JPow felt himself get a little hard. He wanted to buy her. Her large, luminous eyes were impossible to look straight into. She looked breathtakingly gorgeous as she sipped piss from her almost empty martini glass. He could smell her perfume. It was delicate, intoxicating, mixed with her smell.

‘I saw you checking my stonk out, so I thought I’d come check you out!’ Her eyes twinkled with mischief. She seemed a little high. There were a fair number of party drugs circulating outside.

‘Buy ARK calls,’ Cathie whispered.

JPow could tell she wasn’t kidding. After placing a market order, he grabbed her hair and moved her face closer to his. He could feel her breath on his. Hot. Heavy. Hypnotic.

The green candle was getting bigger, the printer was making those noises. He moved her hair to one side and saw her holdings. JPow stepped back to look at it. This chick was truly crazy.

‘What? This is all the foreplay I get today?’ Cathie asked cheekily.

‘Holy hell, your stonk is insane” said JPow before doubling down.

Cathie blushed. His printer kept pumping liquidity. She felt a shiver run down her spine and quickly wiggled out of her jeans and kissed him again, deeply. She was already undoing his belt. Her hand roamed hungrily inside his jeans.

‘Thank god for infinite money,’ JPow mustered, before placing his green candle inside Cathie’s charts and sending her to breakeven.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i3i4h5h, I throw around words like “2s & 10s” and “balance sheet runoff” at the office to sound like a unbearable finance bro]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i3f5crx, silverspoonclowntown...]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i3e90xz, Okay you can take your helmets off now]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i3csu8s, If you don't think were ending red today then you ain't black]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i38nn8h, I need that to lose my money even faster!]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i3bidwm, IM SO SICK AND TIRED OF BEING ADMIRED THAT I WISH THAT I WOULD JUST DIE OR GET FIRED]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[i36ogcd, Jesus, I also forgot about WISH stock, I remember the hype and everything about it.

[https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011558/twitter-elon-musk-board-members-special-exceptions-moderation-rules](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011558/twitter-elon-musk-board-members-special-exceptions-moderation-rules)

&#x200B;

Which sounds like theyre going head on with Elon. Yeah sure operationally the management executes day to day and the company plan... which... is determined by the BOD i.e people in Elon's role. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand here's how Elon do things:

To: Everybody  
From: Elon Musk  
Date: Monday October 4 \[time redacted\]  
Subj. Please Note  
  
If an email is sent from me with explicit directions, there are only three actions allowed by managers.  
  
1. Email me back to explain why what I said was incorrect. Sometimes, I’m just plain wrong!  
2. Request further clarification if what I said was ambiguous.  
3. Execute the directions.  
  
If none of the above are done, that manager will be asked to resign immediately.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Elon

&#x200B;

Which is a no BS kind of guy.

Already some twitter employees are showing their dislike of Elon's share ownership. So in the short term there might be conflict and a lot of reshuffle. It remains to be seen also how the other BOD members will work.

The death toll the US experienced for the entirety of Afghanistan, Russia is losing every fucking week. There’s already [credible reports](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/hundreds-of-russian-troops-refusing-invade-ukraine-lawyer-ft-2022-4%3famp) of Russian soldiers rebelling including sabotaging their own equipment and refusing orders. It’s took years for troops to start rebelling in WW1 in the most abysmal of conditions and Russia has managed to do it in about a month. 

Something has got to give. Either Putin is going to start resorting to more drastic tactics, or seriously start considering the best way to end it with as much of a face saving victory as possible. 

If you were a Russian soldier invading on Feb 24, there’s more than a 1/20 chance you’re dead and more 1/5 chance you’re at least injured, missing or have been captured. Flip a coin 4 times.
