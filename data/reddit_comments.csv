We do a lot to prevent them, but any detection method we put out can just be circumvented as soon as they find out. 

We ultimately rely on Reddit Admins to deal with spammers, ban evasion, etc.  They're the ones with detailed user info. They're the ones who can see the technical details we can't, and can stop spam before its ever visible.

Yesterday I banned a user who was posting ""BB to the moon"" every 6 seconds. Luckily automod was already catching all their comments, but if Reddit Admins can't even catch that, then you can only imagine what more sophisticated spammers will try. -- Anyways, I'll leave it up to you to guess how I feel about their performance thus far.

Second, we *did* have a GME megathread yesterday, and even with that, there were very few comments about GME on it. I even posted [yesterday midday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu8o4x/daily_popular_ticker_thread_for_june_07_2021_bb/h0wxmhl/?context=3) that it was not being discussed enough to make it to today's thread.

[We took your feedback](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nse1dg/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/h0owpty/?context=3) and decided that we shouldn't be the ones picking which stocks get a megathread. 

**You the users decide**.

If there's not enough people discussing GME (or any other stock), do you really want us to step in and force a megathread on it anyways? No, that would be unfair.

What we *can* do, is allow a megathread when there's a special event (E.g. Earnings) for a very highly discussed stock, which is what we're doing tomorrow for GME, as announced yesterday and the day before.

---

As for daily megathreads for each stock, honestly, we tried that before, and although these might be different times, back then it blew up into everyone fighting one another, and one thread being highly upvoted while the rest were downvoted into oblivion. 

That's not a good experience for anyone who isn't in the hivemind, and that's a level of echo chamber we ultimately want to avoid.

---

Please let me know any suggestions you have, always happy to talk about how we can improve.

To your edit, there's literally one comment in this thread talking positively about silver. It's not on the top 10 mentions on the sub in any metric.

Quit your bullshit.

Edit: SLV is the 17th most mentioned ticker in the past 30 minutes, between ROOT, and TAL, both of which I haven't even seen in casual browsing.

You may wonder why this guy is so bullish when we are down intraday.....basically its the idea that if large fish want to buy a large amount they need selling to do so.  Dropping the price intraday provides plenty of shares of people ""selling"" or shorting into them.  


Easier than buying on the way up.  But wait, you get these odd bounces AH that move the stock higher?  Ahhhh the key, no volume to hold the buying down.  Until the next day process repeats until compression is complete and it legs up in a flag pattern style again.

Looking at the sentiment across reddit, I've honestly never seen every style of investor unanimously love a stock this much:

r/stocks likes it ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l2x8u6/thoughts_on_uwmc/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/maral6/whats_happened_with_uwmc/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc_seems_extremely_undervalued_to_me/) threads)

r/investing likes it ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwyyd2/why_does_uwmc_have_large_net_income_but_it_is/)).

r/stockmarket likes it ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/m0f389/exploding_stock_of_the_week_uwm_holdings_uwmc/)).

r/wallstreetbets likes it ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwvsg9/uwmc_stock_analysis/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwufjs/uwmc_the_next_rkt_new_info_3rd_time_posting_hope/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5yvwc/uwmc_key_points_to_the_company/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly2o5t/uwmc/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ahq5/uwmc_dont_be_fooled_my_friends/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/)).

Even fucking r/dividends likes it ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/n67xuq/uwmc_what_are_the_high_risks_with_this_stock/))

Everybody fucking loves this stock. If you think I cherrypicked threads, google ‚ÄúUWMC stock reddit‚Äù and open up the first 50 reddit threads. Read every comment on every one. Everybody. fucking. loves. this. stock. apes.. boomers..  value investors.. whatever the fuck the r/stockmarket people are called, they like it. Plus a lot of these threads calling this a steal are from when this was at $11+/ share. currently at $9. This thing could go up 20% tomorrow and it would still be a steal.

&#x200B;

This thing just needs a little bit of momentum and it's a snowball effect of *everybody* piling in: r/stocks, r/investing, r/stockmarket, r/wallstreetbets, r/dividends are going to load up

My favourite quote from all those threads is in the r/stocks 1st thread. Top comment starts with:

""Breh this is going to run - it‚Äôs just a matter of when""

That was the top voted comment in r/stocks. Closing share price that day: $11.35. It's going up 20%, and *then* r/stocks thinks it's going to run. and that was *pre* buyback

If anyone has any interest, [you can read my full DD here](https://www.reddit.com/user/UWMCThrowaway123/comments/nuxj57/the_easiest_play_on_wall_street_the_value_analyst/).

I bet if, back in January, they let the stock moon to about $1k most people would have sold and bounced and this whole thing could have been avoided. The DD wasn't that widespread then, and going from ~$5 up to ~$1000 would have blown our hair back and convinced us THAT was the squeeze. 

But no, they got fucky and did their manipulative shit and we've gotten wise, now we've been wrestling with the price for almost six months now. we've read the DD. we've seen the media manipulating the narrative.

2)          Research and buy stocks from companies that you believe have potential. Be prepared to hold on for a while for profits.

3)           Try to get into different sectors. If your stocks are too similar they will all rise and fall as a group. 

4)           Pay attention to your wins and losses. Use the information to get better. Never think that the market screwed you. Own your choices and use your experience to grow.

- Not everything is a s**rt sq**ze.

Not exactly a hot take, but that message needs to gain traction. (phrase-ban to the moon! üöÄ)

- Spamming tickers is lame. It sucks all the oxygen out of the room, and it‚Äôs running off the OG apes that built this sub. If your fav ticker has already been mentioned a dozen times in the daily thread, maybe gently ponder to yourself if that 13th ‚ÄúI LiKe the sTonK‚Äù you‚Äôre about to post adds to the conversation, or is at least mildly clever or novel in some way, and if not, plz in the name of all that‚Äôs holy, S.T. ever-loving F.

Take that garbage to s-twits. Elevate the dialogue by declining to participate. Let the OG crew talk and just lurk.  See what they‚Äôre doing right (and wrong!), then steal their best ideas and make some money - like a pro. Trust me, it works if you do it right...

   Bag holding is a right of passage.

I wish this post could get out on fb land (but fuck mark Zuckerberg....prick) and theyd actually get whats taking place. My fear is too many people are buying into too many stocks causing small blips where if, like in the beginning with GME, everyone fixated on 2 stock, or maybe 2, all the funding would cause another spike like we saw. People say ""it costs too much now""... well, im sure plenty of people said the same for GME at 50... I know I did. Then I saw the spike and realized 50 a share would have me banking right now. You drop in $50 x1000 and it goes to 100.. is that much different than the guy who dropped 10 and now has 20? Actually, the guy dropping 50 will profit way more for smaller increases. So... its never too late unless you're an idiot using the light bill money on trades.... about like the fucktards in line at the gas station buying a 22 oz beer buying 200 in lottery tickets, wearing rags and smelling like shitty cat litter...saying ""this is the ticket"" . If you cant lose the money and be okay, dont use it... pay your bills, whats left your willing to roll, roll it. Its a new pair of shitty shoes or 50 on a share that could easily make you 3-4x that.. and then you have a new pair of shoes and more money to roll.. and repeat. PEOPLE NEED TO FOCUS ON 1 OR 2 THAT EVERYONE IS IN ON. STOP PUTTING 5 IN 5 STOCKS, PUT 25 IN ONE AND THERE IS WHERE THE GIFT COMES IN

I've been invested in UWMC since march on a person note, because I felt it offered a much more compelling value, and I'll explain why by giving Rocket's bear case. 

RKT's revenues and net income  is pretty much completely bread and butter mortgage refinance. Rocket Auto comprises a negligible revenue mix, and portion of net income. As does Rocket Homes. Sure, it'll ramp up, but there's a ongoing concern about their ability to make up or the refinance activity they will be losing.

Refinance is papering over a lot of warts, and will continue to do so in 2021. Even so, their both having to compress their margins, and simultaneously doing less volume. Their broker channel, which was the channel they were growing in (not their retail channel) is going to shrink and has shrunk and the margins for them in that area have been reduced to 100 BPS or 1 percent for Q2 2021. UWMC has effectively conducted a box out of their business in this channel with their ultimatum, and because their cost to originate is a measly 50BPS. Yes, you heard that right, UWMC's cost to originate is a measly .50 percent. The lowest of any mortgage originator. And their price matching any loan offer from 14 competitors. So, instead of just buying companies at a premium, their cutting their profit to acquire the equivalent in market share.

To add on, purchases will rise over the next 5 years, but refinance's have been pulled forward and will be negligible in the coming years (regress significantly). As rates rise, wholesale will continue to eat into the mortgage origination market share, as its cost to originate is significantly less than retail due to less fixed cost and the ability to shop around as opposed to having captive customers. 

Stickiness, or cross selling is 91%, but if people aren't coming through the door you won't be able to cross-sell them on rocket auto, etcetera. 

Don't get me wrong, it's balance sheet is strong (Like UWMC), and it will continue to make money, but it's forward p/e in 2023 is going to be an ongoing concern. It was undervalued when it was below its IPO price, i feel, but that is relative.]","[h1a098i, BBullish]",,"[h1b0tao, Agree. My PT is 35]"

1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 51.37% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.   
2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with over 937 mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.   
3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. 

Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.  


Overall, I see crazy potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now!

NOTE 2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes.]",,"[h1cnhn8, So you're saying I can make off with profits twice on a meme stock?

It's standing is completely independent of it's ""meme"" status.  
In fact ""meme"" status insulates any company to an extent from an effect of the rise and fall of it's share price, as this is not caused by company activity, success or failure, and has ""only"" a PR effect that can actually influence the company as a productive entity. And may be temporary (or even disruptive).  
Whichever  **category** of person or institution owns shares in a company is **not** DIRECTLY relevant to that company.

<Unless, of course, it deliberately decides to drop it's previous (possibly shaky) rationale and deliberately BECOME a meme-driven company>

The Canadian's support their concerns, and the government may often be a shareholder (and will be a voting shareholder in a number of 'important' enterprises, natch) but will also support ""unselfishly"" with non-voting shares . This is also true and common in EU countries such as France/Germany/N Europe.

I find it naively obvious the USA population is also ""financially nationalistic"" without being particularly aware of it's own habits or their consequences (like the UK, unfortunately)  but this instinct in the USA is tempered by the drive for short-term personal profit.  
A much **larger** percentage of USA citizens are retail (active) shareholders than is found in other western countries. I believe the sentiment that this is for ""the good of the USA"" is truly minimal.

Comparing and contrasting movement, attitudes, and pro DD, concerning Canadian & EU stock exchanges  and USA exchanges ..  I mean  putting TIME into **comparing** daily and medium-term published DD & comment, and movement (overall ""style"" and ""attitudes"" and ""habits"")   across Euronext and Nasdaq  is revealing and very educative,  - and profitable.   
(profit, however you define it, being the bottom line)

Consider this as a suggested DD overview intro to  ""how foreign stock markets"" work. Take it as the proposal of a 101 to look further afield.  
Sorry to be boring.  
Volatility of American-quoted  (non-meme!) stocks can be disconcerting to outsiders who are not hardened retail crap-shooters.

The extent to which ""meme"" **separates** share price and volatility from ""company activity"" should not be underestimated, especially in the USA.]",,"[h1b4tfn, This is what we need. More fundamental analysis]"

&#x200B;

Sell puts ATM or ITM, collect the premium, wait for assignment - likely to occur when your time is almost expired and BB's price has gone lower than strike price (deeper ITM, the better).  You now have shares - premium received.  i.e. the $ you get is your discount.

&#x200B;

Example:

&#x200B;

BB is about $14 right now.

&#x200B;

Sell 1 put at 14 strike with little time.  Pretend you get $25 dollars per contract.

&#x200B;

If BB continues down, wait for assignment.  If BB goes flat or up, you'll only get the premium not shares.  In that case, simply rinse & repeat until you get shares.

&#x200B;

If assigned,

cost basis is (14 strike \* 100 shares \* 1 contract) - (25 dollars \* 1 contract) = $1375 ; $1400 on the open market

your per share cost is reduced from 14 to 1375/100 = $13.75

&#x200B;

Higher the premium, greater the discount.

Just warning you, if you go for a really long term play don't expect much gains as your money stagnated.

The USPS is the worst of corporations and government control. The USPS will NOT pay that contract out at once and they CAN cancel the contract at any time, there will be many out clauses built in and you won't have a clue because it never has to be reported

Sir Jack Off sold his CLOV shares on Monday, and then went into CLF. The man could have made nearly $2M instead of $500k if he held, but I respect the man's strategy and hindsight is always 20/20.

I have seen many posts and even 10+ minute long videos that don't know the basics of the company from even the past year (quoting what products are already approved/time line of when the next one will be ready.) Here is a simply breakdown of the progress of their products:  
    


Prouduct | Duration |  Finger prick calibration |External transmitter? | RnD stage | Clinical trials | Under review/approval pending | Approved EU | Approved USA
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
Eversence CGM | 90 days | 2x per day | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì
Eversence XL CGM | 180 days | 1x per day | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | **Expected Q3 2021***
Eversense 365 CGM | 365 days | 1x per week* | ‚úì | ‚úì | Q3 2021* | 
Project Gemini | 365 days | Not yet stated/ determined  | Not needed, device fully implanted. |Under development, several years away | 

   
^^*indicats ^^a ^^projected ^^value   
   
   
The 180 day approval is, in my opinion, a huge step forward and makes the product 100 times more appealing. Having the device implanted every 90 days and still finger pricking 2 times a day is still a good commitment of time/effort, but only twice a year and a single finger prick calibration per day? That seems exponentially better, and approval is due to happen some time in the next few weeks to months. When the Eversense 365 product is finished and released, Dexcom and Libre will simply be out of the CGM business in my opinion.    
    
   
One last way-down-the-road thing to add, the CEO in a previous earning report call mentioned the ability to track ""other analytes"" in the future. This could mean tracking other vital signs/measurements with a future design. That would be earth shattering in the medical care field, 24 hour a day monitoring of patient health could revolutionize patient care. Or even athletes tracking statistics for training purposes. This is something that would be years and years away and at this point is just conjecture on my part, but it just shows that there is potential for this company beyond just diabetes care.]",,"[h1a30l4, Moon rockets are made of steel...

The complaint alleges that ContextLogic‚Äôs IPO registration documents materially overstated the company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects.

In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic‚Äôs MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic‚Äôs profitability.  
  
On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already ‚Äúdeclined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.‚Äù  
  
Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic(WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.]"

There's a reason new, different tickers are *relentlessly* spammed every week or two. It's forum sliding. Pushing the play(s) that are ACTUALLY critically dangerous for the SHF out of view, and trying to make it seem like there's genuine, organic sentiment for the new ones. They even try to appeal to exactly the same crowd (GME Apes and brand new retail investors who come here from the media blame game) - ""crush the shorts! the next squeeze! look at this SI%!"" - to get them to believe the real play(s) are over, and that they should sell & put their new money into something else.


Never forget that they got caught with both fists stuck jammed into the cookie jar on GME. 140% SI was just the maximum they could legally report on, and on top of that, they've been shorting nonstop since January to try to force the price down. The squeeze hasn't started.

Nobody is fucking selling.

The average retailer has around 3k in their portfolio. At 5 shares, retail holds 32.5m shares. At 10, they hold 65m shares. At 15, they hold 97.5m shares. At 20 (100% utilisation of average) they hold 130m shares.

I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:   


1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 51.37% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.   
2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with over 937 mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.   
3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. 

Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.  


Overall, I see crazy potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now!

It's not glamorous or sexy, but it's very profitable with a stock like CLF.**   
CLF is running due to higher commodity prices, and analysts are increasing the target price. This is one industry that‚Äôs not hurt by higher prices. In fact, with the global shortage of commodities, CLF is in a great position. They can raise prices without affecting demand, so that should continue to boost earnings. 

If you‚Äôre long CLF, an additional way to profit is to sell covered calls as the price increases. That means you‚Äôre giving someone else the option to buy your calls if it hits the strike price. The good news is that premiums are high enough that you can make a decent gain on calls expiring next Friday (8 days from now). You're not making a long commitment, and you get a quick reward.   
Wait until later in the day for the price to go up (always sell covered calls when the stock is rising), then sell 1 covered call for each 100 shares you own. For example:   
**CLF 06/18/2021 27.00 C (expires in 8 days)**  
Sell to Open at limit price of $1.50 (1 call per 100 shares)  
If you own 1,000 shares, sell 10 Calls at $1.50 will generate an extra $1,500. If it is below $27 next Friday, you pocked the $1,500 premium and you still own the stock. You can then sell more covered calls with higher strike prices as the stock increases, thus making income over and over- until it gets called away. Each time you sell covered calls, you limit the upside, but you effectively lower your purchase price. If it goes above $27 before expiration, you make the profit on the stock up to $27, plus a $1,500 bonus.   
This strategy is ideal for stocks that are steadily rising. If CLF skyrockets, your stock will get called away. If it goes up to $26 and the options expire worthless, you can then sell more covered calls at a higher strike price. This isn‚Äôt as glamorous or sexy as making a 1,000% gain overnight, but CLF is the kind of stock that will likely grind higher and higher, offering an additional income opportunity. ]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[h1b57vp, 700 shares here.

Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know
Mentioned:	CLF
In the latest trading session, Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) closed at $22.96, marking a -1.12% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%.

Heading into today, shares of the mining company had gained 16.27% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.12% in that time.

CLF will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, CLF is projected to report earnings of $1.18 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 480.65%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.75 billion, up 334.97% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.45 per share and revenue of $18.09 billion, which would represent changes of +2517.65% and +237.83%, respectively, from the prior year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CLF. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.66% higher. CLF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Digging into valuation, CLF currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.22. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.34, which means CLF is trading at a discount to the group.

Also, we should mention that CLF has a PEG ratio of 0.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Mining - Miscellaneous industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.13 as of yesterday's close.

The Mining - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, putting it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

Sales grow by 25%, top and bottom line improve.

And something that totally went under the radar: the **mainstream narrative is shifting**. Bloomberg wrote this: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-10/gamestop-s-latest-amazon-hires-show-it-s-not-just-reddit-meme-stock : GME is not a meme.

And big market funds are buying into GME:

This is means we have moved past the visionaries (Cohen, DFV, Dr. Burry, DOMO, Chamath [still dont like him], Cuban)  to the early adopters (AI Funds, early growth funds, market leaders). It will be only a matter of time until a big time hedge funds will jump on the rocket ship, and very publicly so. I give it another quarter before that happens. And don't forget the Russel1K inclusion will buy tons of passive funds into GME.

And if they report a profit for one of the quarters before q4, or even for the whole year, this will go ballistic, because then the SP500 is on the cards.

On top of that, previous SI reported was around 8 to 12 percent. 8 to 12 percent of true float (assuming Bloomberg is wrong would be 275 mil) is around the 48 percent of 66 mil reported. On top of that, there's absolutely no evidence of any float shrinkage. Float shrinkage can be caused by a few reasons, but a 275 mil to 66 mil without any SEC or media evidence seems impossible. I know people aren't going to be happy to hear this, but WISH wasn't the short squeeze we thought it was.

I work at a large-scale machine shop as a cost estimator, we buy direct from mills like Nucor and Eaton Steel.   Our raw material prices have tripled, and we still can't keep up with demand.  **We are the largest North American buyer of bar stock**, and we are on allocation through at least October right now (meaning we cannot increase our orders more, we can only take what is allocated to us).   Our customers(think global hydraulic component mfrs) are continually increasing their orders and we cannot keep up.  Our lead times are months, not weeks.  I have learned that raw material prices (not just steel) are heavily dependent on gasoline demand.  The refining process for gasoline yields the byproducts used to make steel, plastic, batteries, polys, etc etc etc.   As well as transport (diesel is a byproduct of refining gasoline) When overall demand for gasoline is down (like it is now) the price of refinery byproduct goes up.  So the cost to make steel is rising. Transport costs go up because the less gas they refine, the less diesel is produced. Add that price increase to the global labor shortage and the fact that global production capacity is topped out, and steel prices are going nowhere but up for at least the next year.   Steel mills and ancillary businesses should be posting record profits these next few quarters in spite of these cost increases because they can basically name their price right now, and they are.  Our steel costs have tripled this year, and that is highly unusual. Normally steel prices are negotiated once a year. But prices are going up and our business is INCREASING.

step1: '**buy'** 365 more contracts of the same $16 strike @ around 0.1 tomorrow open....for $3650 investment. you'll then have 400 16C contracts @ **$17,090** investment. you may buy 16C contracts for even less...to make total investment even lower.

step2: '**sell**' 400 contracts of $14 strike for around 0.35 ..you get **$14000** credit.

step3: '**hope**' BB closes below $14 tomorrow. then you will keep whole $14000 credit.. your total loss would be $14000-13440-3650 = **'3090'** will be your total loss...instead of the 13k loss otherwise !

If you are able to sell $14 strike calls at the open for more than 0.35 , you'll recover even more...but then probabiltiy of BB closing above 14 also increases...**all this game will work if BB closes below 14**....else, you might have more loss depending on how much more above '14' BB goes..if BB goes to **$16**  you'll be fked with an **$80k margin call**.

There are 6.5m total investors in GME - 1.5% (98k users) of these are from eToro. 62% of eToro users voted. This was ~700,000 shares cast.

We can make an *assumption* that the 1.5% owns *roughly* about 11.5 shares per holder as of April 15th, due to this. When you multiply 11.5 √ó 6.5m you end up with 74.5m. That's just slightly over outstanding shares.

#BUT

The thing is... there *aren't* institutional investors in eToro. The 11.5 share is *entirely based on what eToro GME holders own.*

There is *no evidence* to suggest that eToro holders are significantly demographically different from other brokers, but the ranges are as follows (*assuming* the float is 55m shares):

5 shares = 59% of float is owned by retail.  
10 shares = 118% of float is owned by retail.  
*11.5 shares = 135% of float is owned by retail.*  
15 shares = 177% of float is owned by retail.  

So, why does any of this noise matter? Has anyone *seen* a bloomberg terminal lately for GME? Retail ownership is **vastly** under reported... last I saw it was *<5%* ownership. I'm not saying we *shouldn't* trust Bloomberg terminal, but someone is feeding bogus data somewhere.

S&P 500 is up 0.1%, still not yet at the all-time high set on May 7. That‚Äôs as of 0630.

Today is all about inflation. May‚Äôs CPI report drops at 0830, with economists expecting a rise of 4.7% year-over-year. The core CPI figure is expected to come in at 3.5% YoY Both of these would be increases from April (4.2% and 3%, respectively).

Investors have been waiting for this report for awhile, which explains the subdued volumes we‚Äôve seen all week. The concern of course is that the CPI comes in well ahead of forecasts, showing the Fed is losing the inflation battle (or maybe the battle convincing people this is all transitory). That will lead to concerns the Fed will be forced to raise rates sooner.

Markets will tell the story of course. The question is, if there is a sell-off, would it be an opportunity to buy? I‚Äôll discuss this in the audio. Not gonna type it out.

We also have initial jobless claims at 0830, but expect that to be drowned out.

Worth keeping an eye on Fed futures contracts. This will give an idea of when the market is anticipating the Fed to crack and raise rates. There‚Äôs a contrarian trade there as well, if you believe the Fed will hold fast to their plan to not raise until 2023.

But then if you believe the Fed you probably have bigger issues, no offense.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[h1a5kke, Oh i missed the kindergarten]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
