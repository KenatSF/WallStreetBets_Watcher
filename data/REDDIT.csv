twhpbv,1649117848.0,State of Reddit /r/Place 2022,"It's been a stressful 4 days but it's finally over.  It's been a hell of a struggle after getting wiped out on day 1 and day 2. On day 3 we finally had enough people to solidify our presence in /r/place and defended it till the end.  I guess with 12m subscribers people thought it would be a piece of cake but I knew it would be a struggle.  We had multiple communities work together to attack us at every moment and in the end we persevered.  Those of us who worked together to create have a sense of camaraderie that we might not have had before and have created a bond that brought us closer together as a community through this experiment.  Those who worked to try to make us fail have exposed themselves.  Many friendships were formed amongst those who chose to work together to create something.  Thank you all for participating!

To our incredible allies:

/r/OSUgame:  You guys are champions!   Such an incredible community that spreads a positive vibe.  Whenever we needed your help, you came and brought us back to life every time we were almost wiped out.  We have so much respect for you. WSB thanks you for all you have done to help.

/r/EPITA:   Our new friends from  EPITA - School of Engineering and Computer Science in France.   I don't know what else to say about these individuals.  They stuck by us through all the harassment and helped us rebuild and defend ourselves till the last moment.  You all will always have friends here at wsb.

Also a special thanks to our neighbors and allies from

r/offliners  r/evangelion  r/monkeytype r/Ourworldofpixels r/AnimalCrossing

Thanks for being good neighbors and working with us instead of trying to invade us like the ones we had before.

I feel this experiment brought a sense of community that was missing ever since the gme situation.  Let us continue on the same path and grow from here.

Thank you everyone!

txk1by,1649244718.0,"General thoughts for the short term, summer, and rest of the year","General thoughts, not investing advice. 

If you look at the second half of march conditions, it was primed to run a rally until April. 

The market took a major hit the first quarter. In mid march, rebalancing of funds needed to occur. Equities had lost enough value where there was something like $230 billion plus in money that would be flowing into equities to rebalance. In mid march you had a perfect combination of the fed raising rates and quadruple witching. When the fed raised rates and gave hawkish guidance, people bailed on bonds. There was a rush to the door even. As that money flowed out of bonds, it had to go somewhere. Equities.

This pressure was amplified by option expirations that week. This was the pop necessary to spark a bear market rally (we were already in a bear market from a pure number standpoint). The volume after that was below average. Had the volume been strong, I might have been convinced we had actually hit the bottom. It wasn't. The rally was very weak in terms of fundamentals. Heavy retail investor tilted, going into high growth stocks, particularly low margin, which makes zero fundamental sense. When a strong rally pops up after a big correction, and the rally has no fundamental basis, and lighter than normal volume, you have to start looking at technical analysis.

In order for this market rally to continue in April, it needed to significantly break through the 61.8% retracement that acts as a barrier in many such rallies. That way it becomes a technical analysis resistance floor rather than a ceiling that confirms such traders expectations. Unfortunately, the rally basically hit the 61.8% threshold right at the end of the month, just barely spiking above it briefly before pulling back, right as the month ended.

This is exactly the sort of thing technical analysis traders look for to change their bullish swing trades in the bearish direction and maximize profit. An April sell off was all but inevitable. The question is how far does that sell off run? For spy, we are approaching the first resistance level at 443-447. I think breaking through that this month is definitely looking likely. In which case there doesn't look like much resistance again until 430. I think you'll see some sideways movement or even some small pushes upwards there. A stabilization in the 430-437 range. But I also think at that point we will be heading into earnings and forward guidance will be bad. So going into may I think the losses will resume. I expect we look to try and break below 400 by the end of may. That's a significant resistance level. a 100% continuation down is at 399. So touching that but not breaking too far below it for any length of time will tell us whether we break significantly lower in the summer or whether we slowly try to rebuild from there.

We aren't currently on track for a recession in 2022. When yield curve inversion warning sign takes place, it tends to take a while to play out. History suggests we should end the year about where we are today or a little higher. We won't see new highs this year (470 is a a very long shot) unless the landscape changes significantly. I don't see that happening. Many of these problems are too ingrained. Inflation isn't just going to resolve itself. The supply chain isn't going to magically fix itself this year. The fed can't just completely change course with these two things pressuring inflation upwards the way it has been and will continue to. The may get a little less hawkish if they spark off a liquidity crisis, which given how things are going, isn't impossible. But they aren't going to 180. 

All this is to say that buying up high growth low margin stocks is a really bad play. It's not going to work out. As forward guidance gets revised, interest rates start to play out in the real world, and the new normal starts to ACTUALLY get priced in (not just hand waving, but actual number crunching based on real world data), you're going to see these type of growth stocks come back down to earth. They won't get back to historically normal levels unless a crisis hits and the market washes out completely, but the multiples we've seen won't survive. They can't. The real world results and forward guidance will beat those numbers down kicking and screaming. Looking for stocks that have good numbers today and can keep producing solid numbers during tightening is where you want to have your money. Better yet are cash rich companies that can produce today/tomorrow AND keep investing in new ventures. 

Obviously short term volatility will exist, and that means opportunities to make quick cash. But I think the volatility will favor the downside. There are more companies in a bad position in terms of price and expectations going into the cycle than there are good companies that are undervalued given the environment. 

My general attitude is to get defensive, cash out when it makes sense, and look for potential crisis situations where the market could enter a panic sell off. That will create big opportunities. Where those opportunities are remains to be seen. It will depend on what type of crisis plays out, if any, and the basis for it. Given geopolitical events, this can happen at any time. The risks right now are to the downside in terms of good news vs bad news. I see more potential bad events that could play out than good. This means a higher likelihood of sell offs over booms. 

Anyway, these are just the general thoughts I'm having about how things are looking as we head towards earnings, the summer, and 2023, which will likely have a recession. Recessions are inevitable, and 2022 has all the conditions to spark one. Circumstances could change, but again, the current conditions suggest a higher likelihood of an acceleration in that recession timeline rather than a reversal where we continue the boom cycle years further (and that this is only a temporary correction).

Over the really long term, we will be fine. So if your outlook is 5 years plus, this is all just going to be an annoying speed bump. But if the outlook is 2-3 years, this is going to be a stressful period is what I'm thinking.

twwzbr,1649170920.0,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers,"**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs. The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read.

# Background Information

I'm rewording a previous post and adding another fund onto it... Going to try and make it easier to understand.

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker dealer (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

Thinking of that example, funds are currently lending GME shares to broker dealers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold.

The [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar exposure to securities lending counterparty risks as the broker dealers did who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The broker dealers currently borrowing and lending GME have a [similar exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) to what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic from AIG... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** loaning the GME shares. So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares in the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds contain shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the first post I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

* 138 of 213 funds were loaning GME shares
* 70 funds lent out more than 90% of their GME shares
* An estimated 5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending), and
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) in the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * Note: You'll need to see ""GME Deep Dive: So Much GME Lending"" in my profile for the original post with this info. I have it pinned.

That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund... I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks at the bottom of this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:

[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/7lddv0rb8pr81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a13147fbe642ce67f51476bec0636f4497fbcd4)

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/88b90mog8pr81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a2fe6803e0f02f217938829139f785e82cc17d)

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

https://preview.redd.it/o67gkzxc9pr81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=502bec7e2d34818c3da305caadf38eec9fe83787

The ***fund*** has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:

[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/4q0mn82g9pr81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=6188e2ff74c05db37c78b0ed51acbb6cb033eae5)

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

Many other funds loaning GME shares have similar looking securities borrowers, shareholders, and fund holdings compared to the three funds we've just reviewed. That's a lot of securities lending counterparty risk when you considered the amount of funds loaning GME shares (over 5.72M shares by 138 funds).

Remember, this is just lending from mutual funds and ETFs and does not include other avenues for lending GME shares.

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

*Buckle Up*

Tanks fo reedin

**Note:** I have not extensively reviewed all funds and fund holdings, but GME appears to be one of the most loaned securities held by these funds, if not the most loaned, BUT there is a SUBSTANTIAL amount of securities lending currently happening with these funds so I can't be certain where GME falls.

**Note 2:** I'll leave the post with these quotes that I used in my original post regarding counterparty risk:

**The Counterparty Risk**

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However, in recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can’t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

txahip,1649208277.0,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,"  

Writing this from my new computer which I am very excited that it is finally fully setup and running like a champ! Cant wait to test it intraday tomorrow as my macbook air was struggling for sure with everything I had running at one time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pg01z8rb9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f40b862e8091f058a2b9aa1225817229cdef94c

Intraday today despite a morning start that looked initially to be bullish the bears were able to get control of the day. Of course, this was at the assistance of fed member Brainard who dropped the bomb about balance sheet reductions and the expedited timeline for the fed. This set the market in to quite the tizzy seeing a massive 0.5% sell off within 30 minutes of news dropping. Initially it looked like we may recover after a clear market over-reaction… thinking back to the Saudi oil field attack we had last week. However, after a small pop from the low of 453.8 to 455.5, the bears took back control and took SPY for an impressively bearish close below some key supports for a -1.25% close. 

The one thing I will be considering going into tomorrow if the markets took the opportunity to price in the FOMC minutes tomorrow and that the markets are assuming that JPOW had said and will be more hawkish than anticipated. However, it would not be surprising to see the markets react bullishly tomorrow morning before seeing a massive sell off once minutes drop. Historically thinking back that is how the last few FOMC meetings have gone. 

SPY today closed below a key “ level” of support of 452 today. The next support level is down near 448. It was quite the fight at 452.5 all day but I believe now that we broke below this support we may start seeing some more downside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6v5ln8hc9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb93a32b01582937abea7f41d36cf53fde6fa765

The daily chart for spy is quite bearish now. Looking back to March 29th we formed what I am calling the upper resistance at 462 and now we just may retest support down near 410 over the next month. Also today was the first candle closed BELOW the daily 8ema since March 15th. The bears tried very hard last week to close below but the bulls wouldn’t let it happen. In general a close below the daily 8ema is a bearish omen in the markets. We also broke the grey upward channel today officially. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ap4eb1ad9tr81.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=b71092d47b2ead635df678be2ca94d528598a1b9

The weekly chart is currently set up with another doji but any downward momentum from her will make it a true bear candle. The weekly 20ema and 8ema is still down near 445-446 which could be the target for the bears this week (that is also major supports on the daily chart).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gpk84otd9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=76577eb6a26de0085f71d1840519c9906f3f7276

Apple despite a bearish day tested the support of its channel and it is too close to tell yet on the daily chart if its broke it officially. It did manage to close above its daily 8ema at 174.83 which is a more bullish close for Apple after a -1.89% day. 

But as you can see on both SPY and Apples daily chart their daily MACDs are ready to curl to sell signal and the RSI is looking bearish both near 58 and trailing downward now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgnf66je9tr81.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da093073f245f212471507116e8378ec32a13f0

The VIX had yet another wild day. Opening at 18.55 before climbing all the way to 21.57 before market close. That is another massive day, at 16% run up from low to high is wild for VIX! Again the VIX though was the guide of the market. Despite the expect over-reaction and mid day bullish reversal once the vix continued its slow climb up we knew that was not going to happen. 

Historically 16.5 to 21.5 over the last year or so has been the average VIX Range so we are not at the upper level of that. A VIX back over 22 would be quite bearish also and could allow for some increased volatility that we surely have been lacking. 

I will be gone in the morning with some personal stuff so I am going to include all premarket levels to watch here as I will not have time to post in the morning. I will be back on the server for live chat hopefully by 12 at the latest. 

Support- 

450.9 -> 450.45 à 449.7 à 449.1 à 448.4 à 447.21 (break support of next “level”) 

\-0.5%= 448.7

\-1%= 446.5

\-1.5%= 444.3

\-2%= 442

I would watch for a break of 450 cleanly followed by the break to 447.2. If we can break and hold there a close near the daily 20,50 and 100 ema all near 444-446 is 100% possible. 

Resistance- 

451.5 à 452.2 (break back above next “level” up) à 452.7(major support intraday today) à 453.4 à 454

0.5%= 453.3

1%= 455.5

1.5%= 457.8

2%= 460

Bulls will need a clean gap above 452 resistance that holds, good FOMC news and they could very well see 455 to 457 end of day with a run up near 460-465 to end the week.",False,49,0,DaddyDersch,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/txahip/4522_spy_daily_ta/,False,18

Last week, a United Nations official warned that with the escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Ukraine has changed from a world granary to a team waiting for relief, which has exacerbated the global food shortage and made it difficult for the world food programme to provide food to about 125 million people in need.

David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme (WFP), said: ""this is not just a devastating blow to Ukraine and the region. Its impact on the world will be the worst we have seen since World War II.""

**Transportation difficulties**

Before the outbreak of the Russian Ukrainian conflict, Ukrainian corn could be transported by rail to Black Sea ports such as Odessa and Nikolayev, and then loaded on ships bound for Asia and Europe. But with the closure of the port, a small amount of corn is winding westward through Romania and Poland by railway and then transported abroad.

But worse, unlike European Railways, Ukrainian trains run on a wider Soviet era track, so the wheels must be changed at the border.

Speaking from katerinko, vice president of the Ukrainian agribusiness club, it's not very expensive to deal with the whole issue of food logistics, ""katerinko said

Ukraine is one of the world's largest exporters of corn, wheat and sunflower oil, but the export of these products has basically stagnated. The Ministry of Agriculture said that at present, grain exports are limited to 500000 tons per month, lower than the pre war maximum of 5 million tons, with a loss of 1.5 billion US dollars. Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter, and its wheat production is still increasing, but there are still problems in the delivery and payment of goods in the future.

**Looking for new sources of goods**

Countries worried about food shortages are scrambling to find alternative suppliers, and new trade is emerging.

India used to keep its wheat harvest at home because of the price set by the government. Now, India is vigorously entering the export market to sell wheat all over Asia. In the wheat season that ended last month, India's wheat exports could reach a record 8.5 million tons.

""We will continue to export wheat on a large scale to meet the needs of countries that cannot obtain supplies from conflict areas,"" said Piyush Goyal, India's food and Commerce Minister. ""Our farmers are focused on increasing production.""

India is negotiating opportunities to enter the markets of Egypt, Turkey and China, as well as other potential buyers, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nigeria and Iran, the Ministry of Commerce said.

Brazil's wheat exports in the first three months have also far exceeded those of last year. In the first three months of this year, the country's total wheat exports will reach 2.1 million tons, almost twice that of 2021. Destinations include Turkey, South Africa and Sudan for the first time in at least four years.

In addition, the sales of Australia, a major wheat exporter, is also proceeding at full speed. The transportation force has been booked for several months, and the buyer's cycle of buying wheat is longer than usual. American corn was shipped to Spain for the first time in about four years. Egypt is considering exchanging Romanian grain for fertilizer and negotiating wheat with Argentina.

Dan Basse, President of agricultural market research firm agresource, said that even with these efforts, the situation may not be good enough.

""Finding alternative suppliers is still feasible at the moment. But if the conflict continues into the summer, when wheat exports from the black sea usually accelerate, you will start to have problems. At that time, the world will begin to experience shortages,"" he said.

https://preview.redd.it/h9novusvxtr81.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a778bdccd963cc811be48c4a21a30fefee300c1a

At the same time, importers are also relaxing restrictions to obtain food from more producing areas. Spain, Ukraine's second-largest buyer of corn, relaxed pesticide regulations and allowed the import of feed from Argentina and Brazil. In March this year, the country also imported 145000 tons of corn from the United States, the first batch since 2018, while China, another major corn customer of Ukraine, also increased the purchase of corn in the United States.

**Prices soared**

On the other hand, alternative suppliers have more expensive freight, longer transportation time or different quality, which will further exacerbate the rise of food prices.

The world's food supply has been affected by droughts in Canada and Brazil and traffic jams in parts of the world, from railway congestion in the United States to truck driver strikes in Spain. The impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine made the price index hit a new high. Corn and wheat futures in Chicago have risen by more than 20% since the beginning of this year.

The United Nations warned that food prices, which are already at an all-time high, could rise another 22%. The report said that the serious decline in the export capacity of the Black Sea could lead to malnutrition of up to 13.1 million people, which will exacerbate the intensification of global hunger while the world is still recovering from the impact of the epidemic.

In addition, some governments are restricting trade in response to rising food prices. Serbia, the ninth largest corn exporter, temporarily banned corn exports. Argentina and Indonesia have raised vegetable oil export taxes, and Kazakhstan will restrict wheat exports. The International Grains Council estimates that global grain trade excluding rice could fall by 12 million tons this quarter, the biggest decline in at least a decade.

""High prices tend to lead to protectionism, not just increased exports,"" said Michael magdovitz, senior analyst at Rabobank

Since there is no sign that the tight supply will ease soon, Rabobank predicted in March that by the end of this year, the average price of wheat futures will be $11 or more per bushel and that of corn futures will be $7.75 or more per bushel. This is an increase of 30% or more over the end of 2021.

**Who's the next victim?**

Nathan Cordier, an analyst at market research firm agritel in Paris, said that the main harvest of corn in Brazil will be a few months away. If there is any bad weather in the northern hemisphere, it may mean that the supply of farmers raising pigs and chickens with corn will be reduced.

Alexander doring, Secretary General of the European feed industry organization Fefac, said that some feed plants in southern Italy were closed due to grain shortages. He said that the United States and Argentina are booking supplies, but the two countries need 10 days more transportation time than the Black Sea. The Italian industrial organization assalzoo says some livestock farmers are slaughtering their herds, starting with milk cows.

Giulio USAI, an executive at assalzoo, said Italy imports more than 5 million tons of corn from abroad every year, and producers are struggling to pay their bills as grain prices soar. He said that due to the maritime blockade of the Black Sea, livestock farmers now have little access to supplies from Russia or Ukraine. They are trying to find supplies from America, but this process will ""take time"". He said pig farmers may be the next group at risk.

Miguel Angel higuera Pascual, head of anprogapor, a Spanish pig industry organization, said, ""these are the problems we are trying to solve - how do we change the origin of products to get what we need. This is our current situation and we should try to adjust.""",False,19,0,lilyxu185,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/txd2ib/how_will_the_global_grain_trade_system_be/,False,18

In the case of $GME the share float is 63 million shares. Insiders only own 16% of the company and institutional investors own a very small amount. The total shares outstanding is 76 million so the “float” is largely retail. This makes it difficult for small investors to cause large price swings, but WSB did it through Call Options.

In the case of $AMC, total shares outstanding is 513 million with almost no insider or institutional shareholders. This makes the “float” also 513 million shares owned by retail. It’s almost impossible to move the price without large flows of money from big investors, but WSB did it with Call Options.

$PAA has a large short interest of 6% with a low float/low volume due to a high level of closely held shares. An investor buying the Jan 2024 $12 Call can control 100 shares of $PAA for only  $140.

FB EoY 2023 Price Target: $310 (+29%) based on P/E of 21

Positions: $50K in FB shares, $30K in long-dated ATM LEAPs

TL;DR

- Facebook Reels will take market share from Tik Tok, as they have done before with Instagram stories & Snapchat

- Tik Tok faces significant regulatory risks in the U.S. and EU as concerns of being CCP spyware, while U.S. - China relations are worsening. Their attempts to build out a U.S. development office have been disasterous, with an average turnover of 7 months per employee (source: Linkedin)

- Lina Khan, the new FTC Commissioner, is likely to take Apple and Google to task over their duopoly over the App Store, which will reduce platform risks for $FB

- Investors are largely ignoring fundamentals for $FB when it is sporting the lowest P/E ratio of the big-cap tech stocks and continuing to grow top-line revenue by 38% YoY due to short term sentiment & skepticism towards their Metaverse strategy

- VR adoption has been rising steadily since 2019 and FB is a clear market leader


In February ’22, Facebook reported that its active users had declined for the first time the history of the company – likely due to the growth of rival platform Tiktok - and that Apple’s IDFA changes could cost the company about $10 billion in advertising revenue a year. Shares immediately dropped 27%, or $232 billion in market cap. As of this writing, Facebook trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.3, and a price-to-earnings of 17.
Facebook’s valuation has tanked so badly that it’s priced in nearly every pessimistic outcome. On the day Google announced their intention to make changes similar to IDFA, Facebook’s shares actually rose 1%, implying further IDFA restrictions were already baked into the reduced price. Facebook reported revenue of $125 Billion in 2021, a staggering 37% YoY growth from 2020 – which was already a bloated revenue year thanks to the COVID lockdowns.


For many years, Facebook has been the target of federal regulation, from the Cambridge Analytica Scandal to the WSJ Facebook Archives where a whistleblowing Product Manager painted an image of a company that extracted a portion of its engagement from predating on the insecurities of preteens girls. Meanwhile, a different social media company who extracts the entirety of its engagement from insecure teenagers is on the rise, with Bytedance’s 2021 revenue growing 70% to $51 billion a year, generating a staggering private valuation of $350 billion – making it the most highly valued tech unicorn in the world.
Typically, public markets attract loftier multiples than private markets, as the companies have been vetted through the IPO process and mega funds like Blackstone and Fidelity are less price sensitive than their private equity peers. However, in Facebook and Bytedance we have an interesting spread that’s steadily growing: a Price-to-Sales ratio of 5.2 for Facebook, and 7.0 for Bytedance. This can be explained one of three ways: one: Tiktok enjoys a healthier price-to-earnings ratio (undisclosed, since Bytedance is private) than Facebook. Two: the market is pricing in greater near-term risks associated with Facebook than Bytedance. Three: the market is pricing in stronger future growth for Bytedance than Facebook.


The first explanation is possible, but unlikely. Facebook enjoys an operating margin of 33.4%, an incredible ratio for a company that’s also growing revenues at 38% a year, while already attracting and retaining world-class engineering and product talent. This produces its industry-low price-to-earnings of 17, which is by far the lowest among all $500B+ market cap tech companies (compare to GOOG at 25, AMZN at 52, MSFT at 35, and AAPL at 30). Growth stage social media companies typically run very thin operating margins (Pinterest at 48 P/E) or even in the red (Snapchat at -120 P/E). Bytedance is known to be spending heavily to expand its U.S. offices, but running into severe hiring issues as its current average employee tenure is 7 months (compared to Meta at 18 months).


The second and third explanations are the most likely culprits, but have significant risks of being incorrect. In 2020, Trump threatened to ban Tiktok from the U.S, and Bytedance explored serious talks for a sale of the U.S. assets of the Tiktok product to Microsoft. A federal judge filed an injunction blocking Trump’s ban, but national surveys showed roughly 38% of Americans supported the ban. This is a historical high for any poll involving a Trump decision, which generally experience lowered poll numbers simply because they’re proposed by Trump. In Feb 2022, Facebook rolled out Reels to all users across its products, which cloned nearly every feature from the standalone app.
A few months after Facebook added Stories to Instagram – a copy of the key feature from Snapchat – data showed Instagram stories usage exceeded Snapchat’s and was on track to continue growing 200% a year. Snapchat’s stock tanked 40% overnight, as its marquee feature was reproduced and socialized by the larger giant with little effort. Tiktok’s moat is slight wider than Snapchat – its key strength is in its treasure trove of video data, which have been used to train powerful recommendation algorithms that keep its users scrolling endlessly – early data indicates adoption of reels is quickly ramping up on Facebook. Plotting a Recommendation algorithms’ effectiveness against the amount of data it has produces a logarithmic curve – efficiency scales quickly at first with more data, then the gains become increasingly minor. With Facebook’s network of 3 billion active users, it won’t take longer a few months to reach a critical mass of training data to build strong like-audience recommendations. It may take some effort to build short-form video recommendation muscle on the Reels team – but with Tiktok hemorrhaging talent, recruiting the right data scientists should be simple.


The elephant in the room is Zuckerberg’s bold pronouncement that the company’s future is in the Metaverse. This particular strategic focus is likely compressing the company’s valuation by 15-20%, as investors are still skeptical of VR as the next great platform following smartphones. Facebook’s key initiatives in this area – Oculus and Horizon – have been significant loss leaders, and are expected to continue to pressure the company’s bottom line going forward. Horizon’s MAU is estimated to be lower than 300,000, and Oculus has lost the company an estimated $10 billion to date. Zuckerberg’s primary articulation of this strategy is that it gives Facebook their own platform, instead of living and dying by the whims of Apple and Google. However, early glimmers of hope are beginning to show in the data: recent sales and engagement trends for VR have been rising YoY since 2019, and Facebook is the market leader with 40% of market share.
Even if Zuckerberg’s bet does not pan out, the problem of Platform Independence may sort itself out in the near future as the two smartphone giants face increased scrutiny from the newly minted head of the FTC: Lina Khan, a self-proclaimed opponent of big tech who considers the past ten years of anti-trust litigation as wasted time. Her first published piece in 2012 outlined the depressive effects of Amazon’s publishing arm on the diversity of ideas in books, providing an early hint into her predilection for singling out the monopolistic or duopolistic owners of platforms.


In summary, a bet on Facebook is a bet on one of three outcomes, any one of which would imply at least 40%+ upside to the stock’s current price:


- Facebook Reels overtakes as the premier short-form video platform, either through network effects of Facebook products or federal regulation against Tik Tok

- Facebook achieves a greater deal of platform independence from Google and Apple, either through its continued success in building its own platform or federal regulation against Google and Apple

- Facebook maintains a rapid clip of revenue growth, ending another year with 30%+ growth despite short term headwinds in Tik Tok and Google IDFA, alleviating investors concerns about its ability to grow in current conditions.",False,26,0,jax010,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tx63tk/why_im_buying_fb/,False,55

txa5c8,1649207221.0,Aercap’s (AER) 3.5b loss in aircraft could pop the “aircraft leasing bubble”:,"Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, has submitted an insurance claim for 3.5 billion worth of aircraft and engines that Russia refuses to return.

However, even if they do get the entire insurance claim (unlikely as the claim is going to be fought in court, Loyds of London suggests they should get 10 to 15% https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2022/03/30/660380.htm ) this loss is about much more than the assets/planes themselves.

It reflects a change in how Aercap will be able to do business.

Aercap acts as a “middleman” between investors who offer capital to buy aircraft, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines. However, their unprecedented loss almost certainly means an end of the cheap debt and cheap insurance payments they rely on. 

Aircraft leasing is relatively new over the past 40 years. The number of commercial aircrafts that are leased from a leasing company has grown from 1.7% to 51% of total aircrafts ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/)). 

The growth of this industry is largely based on the C\_pe Town Treaty (can't write the word C\_pe because of the auto moderator thinking I'm pumping), a treaty where all signatory countries agree that that they will facilitate the repossession of assets like planes, trains, farm equipment etc to the original state.  (check out the wikipedia article)

By stealing foreign aircrafts, Russia has broken this treaty, showing that leasing aircrafts is much more risky than previously understood. 

Aercap is highly indebted, owing about as much as it owns in assets (74.5 billion in debts, 74.6b in assets *(before the Russian loss)*. They require access to cheap loans in order to facilitate their position as a middleman between bond investors and airlines. They say so themselves: 

“We have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the GECAS Transaction, \[most recent 30B bond/loan offering\] which has significantly increased our indebtedness and debt service obligations, increasing risks relating to our substantial level of indebtedness” (2021 q4 earnings FORM 20-F, p 6).

**“**To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available” (FORM 20-F, p 7). 

“Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt” (FORM 20-F, p 7).

At the time of borrowing the 30b, before the Russian loss, the company had a  MSCI ESG Rating of “A.” This was largely because investors bought into the C\_pe Town Treaty, seeing planes as assets that are really hard to lose. After Russia stealing the planes, the chances of AerCap ever being able to borrow money again at such a cheap price seems unlikely. 

The same is true for their insurance costs, both the type of insurance AER will have to buy (in order to avoid a similar situation now where they have to fight the claims in court) along with the the increase in premiums to reflect the risk means that their overhead will increase significantly. 

All this means a significant increase in overhead costs in an industry that relies on high amounts of debt.

The thing is, I think JPOW is going to stay hawkish tomorrow. He's been extremely consistent action wise compared to his words. There was plenty of times over the last year, we all expected him to lift the rates because of the inflation that he kept calling transitory.

&#x200B;

Hello,

This is part 2 of my FuboTV DD thread. I will also repost information from the first thread so you don't have to check both of them.

FuboTV has now increased their base package from 64.99 to 69.99 (Source : [https://thestreamable.com/news/fubotv-to-raise-price-by-5-for-existing-subscribers-on-may-1st](https://thestreamable.com/news/fubotv-to-raise-price-by-5-for-existing-subscribers-on-may-1st))

If you check the financial statements of the company don't forget to account for $5 more per subscriber.

FuboTV has high streaming right costs and their profit will come from advertisements and other revenue like online gambling. It's the first thing to understand to be able to comprehend the business model of FuboTV.

Consequently FuboTV best chances of profitability is to grow ads revenue per user.

&#x200B;

**First some numbers with sources :** 

Users spend 130 hours per month on FuboTV (Source : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html) 30secs mark)

Price is expected to rise up to $80 in the future for the subscription and ad revenue is expected to rise between $15 and $20 (Source : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html) 20:45 mark)

Subscribers are expected to rise in the next 5 years between 3 and 5 million subscribers (Source : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html) 23:40 mark)

16% of revenue is spent on marketing only for 100%+ growth in revenue (Source : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-fubotv-ceo-david-gandler-on-the-future-of-streaming.html) 32:00 mark)

Market size between 45m to 50m americans who are willing to pay $80 a month (Source : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiG7S-qgeo&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiG7S-qgeo&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) 1:30 mark)

Profitability will be reached at the 3m range subscribers mark (Source : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU50QfK0soE&ab\_channel=TDAmeritradeNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU50QfK0soE&ab_channel=TDAmeritradeNetwork) 6:00 mark)

Sportsbook customer acquistion cost for other sportsbooks is between $800 to $1000 per customer (Source : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxYNHUW56kQ&ab\_channel=Benzinga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxYNHUW56kQ&ab_channel=Benzinga) 1:01:10 mark)

$22 CPM (Source : fool(.)com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/24/fubotv-inc-fubo-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/ Laura Martin -- Needham and Company -- Analyst question Q&A session Q4 2021)

1.5 million subscribers guidance for 2022 (Source : [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/24/fubotv-inc-fubo-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/24/fubotv-inc-fubo-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/) Zach Silverberg -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Q&A session Q4 2021)

96% of FuboTV subscribers watch sports compared to 30% on the cable ecosystem (Source : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-ZENpIj-E&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-ZENpIj-E&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) 2:25 mark)

CPM for TV ads has been growing every year (Source : [https://www.emarketer.com/chart/230277/average-cpm-us-primetime-tv-upfront-ads-broadcast-vs-cable-2008-2020](https://www.emarketer.com/chart/230277/average-cpm-us-primetime-tv-upfront-ads-broadcast-vs-cable-2008-2020))

Currently $8+ advertising revenue per user per month (Source : [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1484769/000149315221005196/ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1484769/000149315221005196/ex99-1.htm))

&#x200B;

**If FuboTV grows ads revenue from $8 to $12 per user with :**

3m subs : Break even, the company becomes profitable.

5m subs : $240m/y profit

10m subs : $480m/y \*

&#x200B;

**From $8 to $16 which is close to the CEOs target :**

3m subs : $144m/y \*

5m subs : $480m/y \*

10m subs : $920m/y \*

&#x200B;

**With $20 per user which is the high target of David Gandler CEO of FuboTV :**

3m subs : $288m/y profit

5m subs : $720m/y

10m subs : $1.4b/y

&#x200B;

These calculations don't account for Gambling revenue at all. FuboTV didn't reveal enough data yet to calculate it.

Now let's just consider that we reach the target of $16 only, without gambling because it didn't work out as expected to have some conservative estimates.

**Let's calculate the P/E for $16 ad revenue per user for FuboTV.**

5m subs : P/E 12 = $5.76b market cap (500% upside).

P/E 24 = $11.52b market cap (1000% upside).

P/E 36 = $17.28b market cap (1500% upside).

FuboTV is also a potential take over target for giant companies like Amazon and Apple that are trying to grow their online streaming offers like Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV. FuboTV has locked in rights for some NFL matches until 2030. FuboTV has been the fastest growing streaming company in 2021 while YoutubeTV and Hulu lagged behind in terms of new subscribers.

FuboTV's CEO said previously that his ad system was not yet performing at maximum capacity as they were still developing a new bid system, once finished the ad revenue is expected to increase.

FuboTV's has acquired Molotov, a french startup for their dev team as they were unable to find engineers in the USA, in France engineers are twice as cheap and just as good as American engineers. FuboTV has now a technological advantage. They also acquired Edisn, an AI company to be able to recognize in real time what is happening on the TV. This technology alone is a game changer for interactive television.

FuboTV has been acquiring gambling licenses all over the US and are expecting to launch the sportsbook in several new states. 

The first state which is Iowa has been profitable since day one. It's a very small state but YTD FuboTV has been quite profitable with a 10% net profit from bets. 

You can check everything here, open the PDF and search for FuboTV (Source : [https://irgc.iowa.gov/sports-wagering-revenue](https://irgc.iowa.gov/sports-wagering-revenue))

The second state is Arizona, FuboTV has also been profitable since day one in that state (Source : [https://gaming.az.gov/sites/default/files/EW%20Revenue%20Report%20for%20Website%20-%20Jan%202022%20%282%29.pdf](https://gaming.az.gov/sites/default/files/EW%20Revenue%20Report%20for%20Website%20-%20Jan%202022%20%282%29.pdf))

As a bonus, the estimated power saving from cutting the cord is between $8 to $30 per household per month. By using FuboTV not only customers will have a lower subscription cost but will also lower their electric bill. FuboTV can be considered as a green company.

&#x200B;

**Bear thesis :**

Bears believe FuboTV can't be profitable because until today they had negative margins, they didn't take into account the recent price increase from $64.99 to $69.99 and the growing ad revenue per user. Once you take into account everything you start to realize that FuboTV can be very profitable. Keep in mind, all of these calculations are without gambling revenue because I'm not here to sell you a dream to try to make a buck but to give you a realist view of what is going on at FuboTV.

Bears also keep saying that the CEO has sold shares, yes he did sell some shares because his salary is quite small and he was all in on FuboTV. The CEO still hold 1,569,819 shares.

Bears recently said that the cofounder sold shares, which is not exact at 100%. The cofounder has received RSUs and RSUs are taxed as capital gains, he sold shares to cover the tax bill, this is a practice that makes sense because otherwise you owe the taxes even if the stock drops in the future.

tx8dzx,1649201804.0,CAKE PUTs and shorting consumer discretionary,"Shorting consumer discretionary with the rise in gas prices may be more or less consensus. But let’s talk about CAKE in particular. Like most corporate restaurant chains, Cheesecake Factory has all the wrong cost inputs to be a particularly victimized by the recent rise inflation. For them primarily cost impacts aare likely to be primarily derived from labor shortages/wage inflation and higher food costs which are now universal in the restaurant industry. But in addition to this CAKEs target demographic and physical restaurant locations may make it a more ripe ( or rotting) fruit to PUt on the SHoRTS for.

CAKE restaurants are typically located in prominent well to do suburbs … areas much more impacted by gas prices compared to urban footprint restaurants where foot traffic will remain high regardless of gas price, these areas also have a lot of upper middle class customers the same customers that are getting squeezed from rising costs themselves … who likely will be less willing to depart with their precious dollars on another 4.75% (average menu price increase per their 10k) more expensive Shepards pie or low Licious cheesecake at the infamous cheese cake restaurant chain… combine this with large retail space overheads this company will be facing some difficult headwinds in a rising cost environment comparatively. 

Now the stock. Like most these corporate restaurant chains they got hammered in 2020 and then underwent some significant debt  issuance and now the rooster is due to come home. With interest rates rising and the fed selling corporate debt corporate interest payments are gonna March higher … the impact on the corporate debt market should be relatively immediate… this is combined with the fact that in 2021 the 1.7% net operating  profit ( less then the rate of inflation for the year). The company has around a half billion is debt notes … which may be low interest but most are set to expire in 2024 and they will have to service them with new notes because they won’t have the cash. These new notes will be at higher rates… price wise the stock is around a $2billion market cap . And they only pulled in 112 million in 2021 which arguably was one of the better operating years for  restaurants with the reopening and stimulus money. Their forecast call for ~.5% revenue growth for this next year even with the price hikes … if they can only confidently guide for that growth can we expect them to actually deliver ? I personnally think that their Q2 performance will be a net loss and they will be forced to guide downward… overall I think the best is behind this company and fair market value in 2 years time will be just north of 70% of what it is today. I have a price target $31.50 to bottom out the technical trend in place and to be a 50% draw down from post pandemic peak…

tvw3yv,1649057286.0,I love you GME fucktards,"

I work for a US broker and all you GME chads are the highlight of my life. You are literally fucking spot on how trading and settlement works, we get bombarded with amazing fucking questions by you beautiful bastards who think the whole world is on your side when in reality the more money you make the more money we make. I cannot wait for the day GME shoots to the moon and explodes then pours wealth into the fucking lot of you which leads to your happy, based, life because you all fucking deserve it. Hope you read this and realise how high iq and based you are and consequently blow your own loads into my wife.

twx0su,1649171032.0,Taking profits on XOM & OXY to pay for gas,"Gas prices peaked at $4.50/gallon in my neighborhood last week. The release of barrels from reserves is providing a little reprieve, but prices are still high enough to avoid unnecessary road trips.

**Exxon having its best quarter in seven years**

XOM saw oil and gas profits of $9.3 billion last quarter. This marks its highest quarterly profit since at least 2014, prompting US and EU lawmakers to talk about taxing dividends and windfalls. This is in lockstep with oil prices also reaching their highest in seven years due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As Exxon does not hedge oil sales, their profits generally match changes in energy prices. But Exxon's plan to phase out Russian operations could lose the company $4 billion and 1-2% in production.

XOM shares have followed suit, jumping 36% year to date to $83.16 as of Monday. Other energy firms' are expected to post similar earnings.

**OXY leads the pack**

Occidental Petroleum made the news thanks to Warren Buffett's snapping up a 14.6% stake and its own CEO, Vicki Hollub, adding to her own position, indicating confidence in its stock price. According to Yahoo Finance and Zacks, underneath the company's surface is a year-over-year cash flow growth of 142.1%, much higher than many of its peers, where the industry average is closer to -3.9%. In Q1, OXY led the S&P as its top performer even as the overall market closed its first losing quarter in two years.

**My play** Taking in the news, but ignoring the hype, doing my own research, and finding myself with Buffett on this one. Here's my defined outcome strategy, a call spread funded by a cash secured put. $OXY Buy: 1 $57.5 call, Sell: 1 $70 call, Sell: 1 $50 put, Exp: 11/18/22

Profit as long as OXY stays above $49.11, which I'm betting it will and can make up to 27.8% (48.0% annualized)

twosqg,1649141461.0,Palantir Is Now in Space | PLTR,"**Palantir Technologies Inc. launched its first satellite this month allowing information to be processed in orbit, instead of being gathered and sent back to Earth, a step toward broadening the applications of the data analysis software.**

The company, co-founded by the billionaire Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, is working with the Earth-mapping company Satellogic, Inc. 

Palantir said its software will improve the speed and quality of data collected from space.

Palantir, a longtime government contractor, has some experience beyond Earth. It works with the military’s Space Systems Command, among other Pentagon agencies. It’s investing in the space industry and said its software can run on drones, aircraft and now satellites. Its military work has raised controversy over the years.

Karp, the chief executive officer, is seeking to expand his business on this planet, too. He wrote a letter posted to the company’s website last month that used the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to highlight Palantir’s work with the U.S. government and its allies. **He said his company was able to grow because the U.S. “took an interest in software and understood its potential to reshape national defense” and that European nations should follow suit.**

“The continent certainly understands that its defense and that of its allies now requires the development of an indigenous source of strength and capacity to defend itself, and quickly,” Karp wrote. “Our software is in the fight around the world.”

In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said European governments and groups are using its software to organize the distribution of materials such as food and beds to Ukrainian refugees who fled during the war. Palantir’s software is also being used to power military responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he said.

The Senate will vote next and will need at least 60 votes to pass the legislation. The legislation would also impose a federal tax on marijuana sales to provide aid to communities hurt by the so-called ""war on drugs"" policy, which imposes harsh penalties for distribution and use.

Using $NDX as a gauge for risk sentiment due to its focus on tech, the index found support just above its 200-day EMA last week, and when coupled with yesterday’s strong session to reclaim the key 15,000 level, it looks like the index may have formed a swing low. If it can break above last week’s high over the coming days it would open the door for another leg higher, and help cement the idea of this being a sustainable new uptrend in the broader market. 

However, it’s hard to ignore volume on the major indices has been below average during this rally, potentially indicating investor hesitancy amidst the current geopolitical and macroeconomic climate. Both of these narratives could be exacerbated this week with Wednesday’s FOMC Minutes and the West readying additional sanctions on Russia, both of which would likely harm risk-appetite and send stock on another leg lower.

All trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see if the market can hold this rally into the new quarter, or if we see another deep pullback.",False,10,0,FOREXcom,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/twrnq2/is_the_latest_riskon_sentiment_sustainable/,False,8

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

He's bought a lemon- Further evidence towards WISH hypothesis.

He's cool, like a cucumber. It is well known that Ryan Cohen is cooler online than in real life. By EOY his physical form will be frozen and consciousness uploaded to Twitter.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7BY5rWxZ

The fall was initially started with news circulating about one of their Canadian stores handing out some woke pamphlets on privilege which caused some backlash with customers. This was not a corporate decision and thus I think the drop was unwarranted. Anyways, falling lumber prices prob added to the decline in stock price over the past few days. It's bounce on the 300 support has formed a double bottom, a bullish technical pattern. In addition, the macd on the 4hr is cycling back to bullish territory and the rsi is just leaving oversold territory meaning there's room to run if the market cooperates. Finally, there was a break of short term resistance as noted in the chart. I see a short term price target of 340 if markets remain solvent.

tvnuao,1649030372.0,GME - Stock Dividend,"TL;DR short sellers and naked shorts still owe dividends. For short sellers they pay the lender. For naked shorts, they pay the dividend to the buyer. It’s doesn’t make sense to hold the short position if the split is 7:1 or higher. So they’ll have to cover and it could cause a squeeze that could cause a gamma squeeze.

Stock dividend isn’t a normal stock split. It has the same effect of a stock split but the mechanism is different.

Stock split: if there is 100 shares worth $10 each, a stock split, say 2:1 will make 200 shares each worth $5. In this case Hedgies etc don’t have to do anything. Life stays the same. Market cap is still $1000.

Stock Dividend: if there is 100 shares worth $10 and they want to do the same as 2:1 split effectively, the company doesn’t just proclaim a split, instead they give every stock holder a share. Effectively doubling the float as the same as the stock split. Market cap MAY stay high, increase or decrease https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp

The reason why this is a nuclear option on short sellers is that they have to buy an additional share to distribute to share holders they short sold shares to.

Why, that’s the brilliance behind a stock or cash dividend.  

If I buy a share and lend it out, and the person who borrowed it sold it, I’m still entitled to the dividend. The company will pay me the dividend. But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.

There’s 15M shorts (not including naked or phantom shares) Plus there’s the options chain, which is 10M shares at $200, 15M at $250, 20M at $300 (note my data only looks up to a year so it could be way more!!) So as shorts cover they’ll run into a gamma squeeze.

The free float is 63M.
Insiders own 11M or 17%
Institutions own  16M or 26%
The near other half owned by individuals.

This is why a stock split it a nuclear option.

It forces short sellers to buy back shares before the ex dividend date probably sometime in June.

If they don’t they’re are on the hook for additional shares ie if the split is 2:1, they’ll have to buy 15M shares, if 3:1 30M shares, and if 7:1 they’ll buy 90M shares.

So I bet the split will be higher than the outstanding shares available of 75M. 6:1 will require 5 x 15M shares bought which is 75M. So 7:1 will cause a case where the shares that need to be bought will be higher than the float.

I’m not going to time when things will explode, short sellers are playing a dangerous game. Friday morning they dumped 1M shares at open:

https://i.imgur.com/gLZy29J.png (at the time of the dump, short sales jump 1M)

Also the stock dividend is perfect vehicle to make the stock grow massively. Just look at Tesla:

https://imgur.com/a/lF6WVPr

So I’m just loading up now, don’t care about the price now for me because I know it’ll at least double. If 7:1, it’ll be historical.

twlwj1,1649130598.0,The Bull Case for Plains All American - The $PAA Board of Directors will meet soon & announce a dividend increase of 21% as recommended by management during the Q4 Earnings Call. This increase implies a proportional increase in share price.,"Historically $PAA trades at a yield of 6%-7% at the increased distribution of $0.87 recommended by management to be implemented for Q1 this implies a price range of $12.50-$14.50.

In reviewing the March investor presentation on the [$PAA investor relations website](https://ir.paalp.com), we see that $PAA has 250% distribution coverage which implies significant excess free cash flow once the leverage target of 4.00 is achieved at the end of 2022. 

$PAA targets a coverage ratio of 150%. This implies that the distribution could double next year from $0.87 to $1.74 and still be at target. 

Conservatively, if the distribution is raised to $1.08 next year (a highly plausible 24% increase over $0.87) the historic yield of 6%-7% implies a price of $15.43 - $18.00 per share in 2023. 

In the near term, the pre-announced distribution increase will result in a re-pricing of the common units from $10.99 as of today’s close to around $14 over the next few weeks.

In comparison, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey holds a 2.25% stake. This move comes after Musk's criticism of Twitter for ""failing to adhere to free speech principles"" and recent announcement to his 80 million followers that he's giving some ""serious thought"" to building his own social media platform. After news of the purchase broke, Twitter shares jumped more than 25% in pre-market.

Trailblazer Elon Musk has decided to invest in Twitter instead of becoming its rival. According to experts, Twitter isn't going anywhere but up. It is the go-to platform for ""real-time conversations"" and where influential people share their thoughts with no editing. Twitter is also building out competitive features such as groups and downvoting, while its audio-capable Twitter Spaces is becoming very popular with journalists.

It's hard to know what to expect in this new era of investing, where a single tweet can cause markets to react wildly and immediately. If you're thinking of following in Musk's footsteps and taking a stake in Twitter, here's a strategy based on solid math and protective hedging, instead of extreme hype.

**Can the Offer be extended and under what circumstances?**

Yes. We have agreed in the Merger Agreement that, subject to our rights to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Offer may be extended from time to time as follows:

as required by applicable law (including for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC);

in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer if and only to the extent required to comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC;

and  if, at the then scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition (as defined under Section 1—“Terms of the Offer” below) has not been satisfied (and the Parent or the Offeror has not, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived such condition in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement), for one or more periods specified by the Offeror (not in excess of 10 business days each) but not (without the prior written consent of the Company) beyond **August 22, 2022** (the “Outside Date”), except that, if, at the then scheduled Expiration Time, the Minimum Condition is the only Offer Condition that has not been satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement), the Offeror may, but is not be obligated to, so extend the Offer (not more than four times without the approval of the Company), unless requested by the Company, in which case, the Offeror will so extend the Offer; provided, that if all of the Offer Conditions other than the Inside Date Condition (and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time) have been satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Offeror will extend the Offer until one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day that is the first business day after the Inside Date (as defined in Section 11—“Purpose of the Offer and Plans for HMH; Transaction Documents” below).

**How will I be notified if the Offer is extended?**

If we extend the Offer, we will inform the Depositary and Paying Agent for the Offer of that fact and will make a public announcement of the extension no later than 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the business day after the day on which the Offer was scheduled to expire.

**What will happen to outstanding Company stock options?**

Effective as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Company Shares (each, a “Company Stock Option”) will vest in full and automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from HMH an amount of cash (subject to any applicable withholding tax) equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per Company Share subject to such Company Stock Option. However, if the Merger Consideration is equal to or less than the exercise price of a Company Stock Option, then such Company Stock Option will be cancelled without any cash or other consideration being paid or provided in respect of the Company Stock Option to its holder and will have no further force or effect. The cash payment in respect of each Company Stock Option will be paid by HMH through HMH’s payroll system as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within 10 business days after the Effective Time). The Parent and HMH may, to the extent mutually agreed, treat Company Stock Options held by employees of HMH and its subsidiaries (each a “Company Employee”) subject to non-U.S. law in a manner other than as provided above to the extent necessary to take into account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

1. Terms of the Offer Upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the Offer Conditions (as defined below), we have agreed in the Merger Agreement to accept for payment and pay for all Company Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the Expiration Time in accordance with the procedures described in Section 4—“Withdrawal Rights.” The term “Expiration Time” means one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 1, 2022 (the date that is 20 business days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer), unless the Offeror, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, has extended the Offer, in which event the term “Expiration Time” means the latest time and date at which the offering period of the Offer, as so extended by the Offeror, will expire. For purposes of the Offer, as provided under the Exchange Act, a “business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a U.S. federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time.

twb908,1649101930.0,Options and You,"**Intro**

Standardized option contracts are insurance instruments at their core. However, we like to use them for speculation because option contracts are leveraged products. Options can be traded like any other security, or they can be exercised.

**Calls**

A call option is a standardized contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying security at an agreed upon price (strike) within a specified period of time (expiration). For stocks, these contracts are denominated by 100 shares. 1 call option gives the buyer the right to by 100 shares of the underlying by the expiration date. The call buyer pays the option writer a fee for this right (premium). The premium is valued with the Black-Scholes model, which is a lesson for another time.

Someone that sells a call option is called the ""writer"" and they are committing to selling the underlying security at an agreed upon price (strike) within a specified period of time. Selling a call obligates you to sell the underlying if it is in the money and exercised by the option buyer. This is where the underlying gets ""called away"". Option writers often sell contracts and then buy to close the contract before expiration because they can collect the difference as profit.

Speculators like us buy calls because it gives us unlimited upside and risk is capped at the premium we pay for the contracts. We buy to open and then sell to close for a profit...oftentimes a loss.

**Puts**

A put option is a standardized contact that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at an agreed upon price (strike) within a specified period of time (expiration).

Someone that sells a put option is called the ""writer"" and they are committing to buying the underlying security at an agreed upon price (strike) within a specified period of time (expiration). Again, if you sell a put and the underlying drops into the money then you are at risk of getting exercised and having to be ""put"" to the underlying by buying however many shares you agreed upon.

Speculators like us buy puts because we are betting that the underlying will either drop, or continue to drop after it has already gone down 50%.

**Greeks**

The Greeks are mathematical representations of what the market is pricing into an option's value. These consist of *Delta*, *Vega*, *Gamma*, and *Theta*. We don't talk about *Rho*. We also don't talk about second-order Greeks like *Vomma*.

*Delta*: The price movement implied by a $1 move in the underlying. Stocks have hard deltas of 1 whereas options contracts have soft deltas between 0 to 1 or 0 to -1. Calls have positive deltas and puts have negative deltas. If you have 100 shares of stock and the price moves up $1, you make $100. If you own 1 call option with a .50 delta and the underlying moves up $1, then all other things being equal, the option premium increased by $50. Leverage. People also like to think of delta as a probability model but that's not accurate IMO. A .50 delta does not mean you have a 50% chance of being in the money.

*Vega*: The price effect on the premium for each point of implied volatility (IV). When IV is higher than historical volatility (HV) the options market is already pricing options to reflect crazy swings in the price...which means a higher chance that you'll lose money by buying those options even if you call the direction correctly. Vega is always highest at the money and decreases the further ITM or OTM that you go. I like checking Vega levels on options because it tells me how much convexity there is. A higher overall Vega means that there is a higher chance to ride the lightning and make serious gains.

*Gamma*: The rate of change in delta for each $1 move in the underlying. It really just tells you how much delta will change and you can see this math work out inside the options chain. Similar to Vega, this helps us determine the potential convexity of the option price. Again, it is always highest ATM or just inside the money (ITM) and drops the further ITM or OTM that you go.

*Theta*: Time decay is always the enemy for options buyers and is the amount of premium that is lost every day until expiration. Theta is always a negative number so if your option has a theta of .07 for example, it means the option loses $7 per day. This will accelerate the closer you get to expiration until the option's value expires at $0. Shorted dated options will have a higher theta than longer dated options, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous for you.

**Extrinsic and Intrinsic Value**

Option's value (premium) is split between extrinsic value and intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is the time left + implied volatility + dividend risk + interest rate risk. Intrinsic value is made up of the difference between the strike price and market price because the option is in the money (ITM). All out of the money (OTM) options have 0 intrinsic value whereas in the money (ITM) options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value.

**Wrap Up**

At the end of the day, speculating on options requires large price movements on the underlying because changes in Theta and Vega will erode the value of your options until they become worthless. You need to pay attention to what the options market is pricing in, identify asymmetry, and really just get lucky to make it work.

New changes will come to Twitter after Elon plays a more influential role on Twitter management's decisions in future (if he attempts a buyout). It is impossible to know how this will impact TWTR share price in long term, but I would bet that it will be a positive one:

1. Elon's publicity helps in rebranding Twitter into something cooler that appeals to retail investors (Twitter is now a meme stock)
2. TSLA whales may buy TWTR shares
3. Some hedge funds may see this as an opportunity to play both sides -> more trading volume -> more volatility -> higher chance of higher share price

I plan to add into TWTR positions slowly over next few weeks (shares, short puts, ITM vertical call spreads, and leaps etc.).

twcuwc,1649105854.0,TSLA to $3000,"Just think about what you could do if you could 3x your money, guaranteed. You might actually be able to buy a boxable home in Austin and join the tech bros. You might even be able to buy a Tesla. If you don't want to help Tesla stock go to $3000 so that you can buy a Tesla and flex on your friends, then you are selfish and hate the environment. There is nothing better for getting pussy than flexing your wealth while carbon shaming all the poor people. Why do people have gas guzzling cars anyway? By increasing the amount of coal being burnt for all our Teslas we will accelerate the timetable for switching over to clean energy. By doing activist investing, and buying Teslas with those free money 3x gains, we can save the Earth and our bank accounts.

Tesla is not a car company; it's an energy company. Teslas are the best cars made by any company on the planet. Or other planets for that matter. When Elon goes to Mars the Martians will buy Teslas so don't tell me how the Earth's population cannot support the current projections. 

Does Elon Musk use his tech bros following to make easy money on TSLA, doggy money, TWTR and other things? Probably, but that's the way it should be. Why should we let Bezos overtake our lord and savior Elon Musk? Investing in the 2020s is all about how you feel. By investing in TSLA you are donating to Elon Musk so that he can save the environment and colonize Mars. 

Mama Cathie says TSLA should grow to $3000 by 2025. The stock should just be $3000 now if it's going to be worth $3000 why isn't that priced in why wait 3 more years? Just buy it if it is below $3000. It's a free lunch. And don't forget to take your gains to buy a Tesla, unless you can't afford one.

See this: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tuxtu7/hmhc_june_225_calls_will_1020x_by_next_friday/

In short, VerItas is offering $21 per share to acquire HMHC, but so far no much interest gathered (only 0.6% tendered as of now). Now I know institution holders usually tender at last moment. But consider this: Veritas had moved the deadline from 1/4 to 6/4 which imo means they have not secured enough shares (they need 50%+1)

Scenario:

	1.	Deal goes through
  Your calls likely go to 0.

	2.	Tender rejected and Veritas up their offer
   Major shareholders who came out to reject the offer estimated a fair price at ~$28. If Veritas reoffers $23 or up you are in profit territory.

	3.	Tender rejcted and Veritas walk away
   imo this is still bullish considering 80% shares are held by institution and already in profit.

tvgb6i,1649011187.0,"""bUT AMc iS CHeapEr ThAN GmE !!!"" Proven Wrong With Data","# Intro

Recently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of ""POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME"" or ""Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?"" or my personal favorite ""if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!"".

All of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.

Here are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a ""DD"" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886

There are others, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.

Here is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:

If company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.

If this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.

This ""trick"" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.

The psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a ""deal"" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.

&#x200B;

# The Proof

I took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54

The X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.

&#x200B;

# Let's do a hypothetical.

If you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.

(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)

I'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.

Now, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.

In this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.

In the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.

https://preview.redd.it/nztqxpt8zcr81.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc5f575d1bd9eb74ae0d7f4b598f4de2935c853

But price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes.

twcwrb,1649105982.0,"BUY HIGH, SELL LOW (method)","**Buy** ***HIGH*** and **sell LOW** is probably something you have never heard of... right? Exactly.

That  is precisely why this method is going to lead the next generation of  traders. Think: If you were to buy into a stock early (when it is still  unheard of), you are more likely to sell it for a higher profit. Right?

***I'M STILL UNSURE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT:***

Okay  let's just jump right into it. First off I'd like to say that I am not  trying to sell you a course, or scam you in anyway. I just want to share  my personal findings and insights into new creative ways of tackling  the market. We don't grow by doing the same thing over and over again,  do we? No, we become complacent, comfortable, and eventually reach our  demise.

IF we want to be successful traders, who make profits never been seen before we must ***THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.*** Think of great wealthy men like Warren Buffet. He had to *THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX* as well.

***HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:***

Imagine  a stock that is being sold for a very high price.... compare this to a  'surprise attack'. Many battles have been won through the art of  'surprise'. *Expect the unexpected.* But when you can't expect it, you are unprepared, and you're most likely to fail.

When  we buy a stock for a high price, and sell it for a low price, we  actually lose A LOT of money. Who would ever expect a sane, logical  person to do this? NO ONE. Who do you think made more money? The very  FIRST person to come across gold? Or the person whose come across it  after its been saturated?

Read up on efficient market theory, and follow its tenants. The only real way to beat the market should be to go against its basist principals. With a little bit of luck, this should pay off.

No one expects a ***'buy high and sell low'*** approach... and that is EXACTLY why this WORKS.  
If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.

twbk5s,1649102655.0,NVDA in trouble by the end of the year?,"Holding about 800 shares.  Forecasting the rest of the year and seeing something I don’t like, but maybe one of you is better informed?

NVDA is selling between 25% and 57% of all graphics cards to cryptominers.  In August moves away from proof of work, meaning no more mining it.  This is to get rid of the energy usage to run the currency.  I’ve been watching for 3 months and the amount of cards showing up on eBay is growing drastically and getting cheaper.  Miners are trying to cash out their cards before they take a big hit in value.  

NVDA has enjoyed stock sellouts because of chip shortages and I feel mainly because of miners.  The cost of the highest end GPU’s has almost tripled because of this demand.  NVDA has been trying to ramp production to capitalize and sounds like q2 and q3 they will pump out record stock at record prices.  

Is there an issue if literally 10’s of thousands of the top cards are liquidated on the used market, for next to nothing, more and more heading into August (cards used for mining lose a lot of value).  Right when NVDA is losing their biggest customer (miners) and releasing a new expensive card in huge quantities.

Cost to borrow has been relatively flat for AMC since the June run up. Through volatility and scarcity in shares it was low. It looks like it is reverse coursing upward now according to Ortex data. This is good news for bulls and bad for bears.

https://preview.redd.it/mh97bvi5nkr81.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f9cbd46204cea6c990a99ae42f9df4f2c8ac50

Utilization \[% of total shares that are lendable that are actually borrowed\] has been sitting at 100% for some time now, last time it did this was prior to its run in June. The times it came down from 100% utilization were when it bounced up a bit on the first initial volume spike then the price came down a bit and then Utilization popped back to 100% and it then ran to $70. I have a feeling we see a dip in Utilization due to the recent run to $34 and a spike back up to 100% after it got shot back down in the next update.

https://preview.redd.it/rb0b35d4nkr81.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=af194a7bbc89c473170b1657e23fdd041293d4c5

Volume has done rips and then dips then finally a rip on both the January and June run up. This seems to be a similar trend on AMC right now. Maybe it leads to something? Will there be a second volume bounce now that it cooled off for a few days? I believe it will but who really knows?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vs1zmngankr81.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=41bfe6aa59ce4e2c8f350237e4677e918d0cbc9a

Shares on loan average were 60 days prior to June run up. Who the fuck holds a short position over 30 days unless they are dumbasses? Well now its fuckin 80 days man. Holy shit what is wrong with them... they could have covered at $12.90 and then renewed a short position now at a much higher level. The average short fuckin held through that. They either CANT cover because it is too much or they truly think it will come down back to $12 and below.

https://preview.redd.it/7fpgxo3cnkr81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=8767ec5e21ba2a3a1e7ab4d9081e2c7b4fd03f5a

Days to cover in all 4 \[2 week/3 month on loan/estimated SI\] have all shown a up move, then a drop, then a short cool off before having second drop in the June run up. Currently DTC on all 4 have dropped, now its is cooling off.. will we see a second drop in DTC indicators?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ups6dukdnkr81.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8f018ce0e3b275b3f47f760785fb3531226cc8

Then finally, higher short interest then the June run up. Shares on loan are less \[even with 100% utilization\], to me this just means the short sellers have less shares to try and push this shit back down after it does rip. Maybe I am wrong. Correct me if so.

I can talk about fundamentals improvements \[long line up of movies, sitting on a shit ton of cash, gold mine investment actually worked out for them, debt pushed to 2029 from 2026 with some high interest debt paid, they are going to make a popcorn product to buy at grocery stores and they are also coming out with a credit card\]. With all the fundamental improvements alone, I dont see this shit being less then $30 just because it held so high and for such a long time last year. $30+ in my opinion.

First, lets talk about individual stocks, apple up 21% in 20 days, 15 trading days. Biggest since 2003, why? No reason, apple is a great company but this recent run was not stimulated by anything.
Tsla, missed delivery, ran 51% in the past 22 days. I cant think of anything but a pump. People buy tesla because its elon and because its tesla, but u cant really think thaflt this price is a fair reflection of the company. 

Now the markets in generla. S&P 11% run in 15 days, sitting at 4% of ath. 
Nasdaq 17% run in 15 days, sitting at 9% of ath. 

I cant see a legitimat reason for such optimism, inflation is highest since 1987, oil prices are up 56% since december. Fed has just hinted more aggresive interest hikes. 

I think this is happening becauwe of the fear. Think about this, when inflation is 8% and is projected to be much higher, you wont be buying 5 year bonds for 2.6% gain. The only investment that can beat this inflation is stocks, as we have seen u could have made 17% with nasdaq if u bought is 3 weeks ago. 

These companies are obviously overbought, but this creates more opportunities, think about this, if evertyhing traded at its value the only way to make money would be long term investing. 

Remember a year ago ev stock ran 300%, rhey dident have to be profitable, have a plan, or any product. They just needed to be ev. I mean how do u ration buying a company valuet at 9B with 0 earning and no product.

tx4tq0,1649191944.0,Haven’t written in a while. I’ll explain Elon Musk & Twitter,"I’m a content creator on Tiktok that started here on Reddit. Auto-moderating is a serious problem that harms social media and gaming and is the primary reason I stopped writing DD for Wall Street bets.

This affects social environments, whether it’s Roblox, League of legends, TikTok, or Meta. Eventually social media will offer more financial services and people will fundamentally depend on these kinds of things for banking (most of the world is underbanked)


So here’s the problem - you can be cut off your financial services, relationships, and progress due to an algorithm.
I’m currently banned on Tiktok for posting an image of Rihanna’s ANTI album. Week long ban for minor safety.

Twitter has been investing in a project called Bluesky. It’s going to implement these things called decentralized identities which is being developed in, right now, by Block called tbDEX. What this means is that, even if I get banned on Tiktok, I can still communicate to them. 

We have said it for a generation. If the media is free, YOU are the product. These social media apps did not create my following, they simply gave me an environment to create one. It’s the equivalent of a bank closing your account AND telling you that you can no longer do business and communicate with your clients. 

Who’s the ceo of Block? Jack Dorsey, the previous CEO of Twitter. 


So that’s it. All of this discussion around free speech will eventually have a product. Twitter is best fit to decentralize since the entire app is built around the message, or the Tweet. So you see tweets EVERYWHERE whether it’s on Reddit, the local news, or your city billboards. 

That’s all. See you guys later.

The impact on Japanese Yen is nothing but cumulative impact of Trade and Monetary policy errors of Central Banks in Japan. Unlimited QE, Yield curve control and holding each and every Assets with lots of Central Banks intervention since 3 decades has created vast amount of debt in the system. But now Japan has entered into Inflation phase where the negative Bond yields have now turned into positive Bond yields but yet the central banks are in no mood to shrink the balance sheet and still are living in the bazooka of providing unlimited liquidity and increasing those Debt to GDP level. While globally, central Banks are in the spree of increasing Interest rates like Bank of Canada or Bank of England or US Fed or Reserve Bank of Australia or Central Bank in New Zealand, Central Bank of Japan believes in Erdogan style of Policies in Turkey and refrained from increasing the Interest rates  yen sank and was followed by Chinese devaluation. Current conditions in China are so desperate that the idea of devaluation does not seem so far-fetched as the economy is affected with pandemic,fall in real estate sales and corporate debt troubles of real estate companies, lack of significant growth in consumption to wean off the dollar trade and impact of inflation on Chinese food supply.

* Charging demand will increase with the EV market. 
* There will be mergers over the next few years—probably quite a few of them. The nature of their biz lends well to buying eachother out, rather than just going bankrupt and fucking off. (Why dig up a parking lot for fresh wires when you can jack someone's shit instead?) 

The potential for rapid consolidation has already been noted by bigger fish:

tw1d6c,1649077038.0,Why Gold Coin Demand Doesn't Drive the Gold Price,"Demand for newly fabricated coins makes up only a small part of total trading volume in gold, and therefore has little impact on the gold price.

As we discussed in a previous article about the supply and demand dynamics of gold, the price of gold isn’t set between what is annually produced versus “consumed.” Because gold isn’t used up and there are vast above ground stocks (most of which is gold held for monetary purposes), the gold price is mainly determined by trade in above ground metal.

Gold trades as a currency. Demand for coins is just a small segment of total physical trading volume, and therefore doesn’t have a significant impact on the price.

Gold Prices Aren't Affected By Gold Coin Sales

Gold investors often wonder why the gold price doesn’t rise when premiums on coins are skyrocketing. The explanation is that these premiums arise from coin supply chain congestions, not from a shortage of gold itself.

Every gold product—an ornament, ring, bar, coin, etc.—needs to be manufactured. The manufacturing costs for, i.e., bars are fixed, but relatively lower for bars with a higher weight and value. A fixed manufacturing cost of $60 dollars is 0.008% of the value of a 400-ounce gold bar, while a little over 3% of the value of a 1-ounce bar.

The spot price of gold on your screen usually refers to the price of gold located in London—the most liquid spot wholesale market—in the form of 400-ounce bars. Products of lower weights than wholesale bars always enjoy a premium on top of the spot price. And products with high manufacturing costs, like coins, enjoy an even higher premium.
In the charts below you can see the sales figures of all U.S. Mint gold (and silver) coins since the 1980s. Clearly, gold coin demand is very volatile. In some months the U.S. Mint might sell as much as 250,000 troy ounces in coins, in other months not more than 10,000 troy ounces.

How Modern Gold Coins Are Made

Like every factory, the U.S. Mint has a certain production capacity that can’t be adjusted on short notice. For fabricating gold coins, 400-ounce bars are rolled into sheets having the thickness of the series of coins the Mint wants to produce.

Next, blanks (“planchets”) are stamped from the sheets, after which these can be struck into coins using a die. Finally, the coins will be manually inspected for imperfections. In all, this is not a process that can be easily speed up or dialed down.

Watch this video to see how the United States Mint manufactures its bullion coins.
Understanding Gold Demand From a Global Perspective

When demand takes a nosedive, the Mint will lower its production capacity and add coins to its inventory. When demand increases all inventory is depleted and production capacity is increased, but it’s impossible for customers to get immediate delivery of their orders.
Coin supply is inelastic. A shortage of coins—not gold itself—causes coin premiums to rise above their averages. (For silver coins the average premiums are relatively higher as an ounce of silver is cheaper than an ounce of gold.)

Demand for gold coins must be seen as a retail sentiment indicator for a specific group of buyers. While premiums on gold coins in the U.S. can be sky high, gold in China can trade at a steep discount, versus London spot, as happened in 2020.

Consider that if for whatever reason there is a shortage of nails on one continent, this doesn’t mean the global price of steel should rise. Likewise, if gold coin demand in the West is high, this doesn’t mean the gold price should rise.

Because gold is a currency there can’t be a shortage of gold itself. But there can be a shortage of specific gold products at specific locations due to supply chain issues.

tw7e4k,1649092465.0,Case for Global Foundries ($GFS),"I believe Global Foundries ($GFS) to be an underdiscussed and **undervalued** sleeping giant.

**Full disclosure, 10% of my portfolio is allocated to GFS**, and I will do my best to lay out my side of the argument and I am open to hearing others.

GFS is a major player is the ever growing semi-conductor market. I live locally and have personally witnessed the massive growth this company has seen. 

There is a growing demand for semi-conductors from not only the home and office computing aspect, but with national security/defense, electric vehicles, data centers, and more. Almost everything we use and will need to use in the future runs on these chips.

The U.S and Europe specifically have been put into this position where moving toward chip independence can no longer be placed on the back burner and must be prioritized. The U.S. Senate on 3/27 approved a bill to provide $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing

TSMC has been a large provider of chips for a variety of companies and countries however with the current geopolitical state with China and Russia it is becoming a less risk adverse play due to being located in Taiwan which leads me to Global Foundries.


Since we cant see the financials of the future lets see how they performed last year

**Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights**

Record revenue of $1.85 billion, up 9% sequentially.
Record gross margin of 20.8% and adjusted gross margin of 21.5%.
Record operating margin of 5% and adjusted operating margin of 8%.
Net income margin of 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%.
Cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion.

**Full Year 2021 Highlights**
Revenue of $6.6 billion, up 36% year-over-year.
Record gross margin of 15% and adjusted gross margin of 16%.

GlobalFoundries chips are found inside smartphones, laptops, automobiles, VR systems, video game consoles, smart speakers, and are also used in artificial intelligence and 5G

Global Foundries has customers such as Ford, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Qorvo

and on March 7th GlobalFoundries announced it is delivering Next-Gen Silicon Photonics Solutions collaborating with industry leaders including Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc, Marvell and NVIDIA, along with breakthrough photonic leaders including Ayar Labs, Lightmatter, PsiQuantum, Ranovus and Xanadu, to deliver innovative, unique, feature-rich solutions to solve some of the biggest challenges facing data centers today.

As of today $GFS is trading at 62.18 and I believe in the next 6-12 months with the explosion of electric vehicles and sustained/increased demand with the expansion of fabs and projected revenue increases we will see a price estimate of $80 on average with a high of $100.

It is: **WENDY'S ($WEN)**🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**HERE'S WHY I FEEL THIS STOCK IS GOING TO REBOUND HARD THIS WEEK**

*Reason 1:* I used a goldfish to pick it and usually I wouldn't make decisions on a goldfish but this one I agree with 100%

*Reason 2:* Biggest balls of any fast food chain, see photo:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vrpo6vl34fr81.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff5bfc368661cafb9bb6dba9c83dcf5ab878909

&#x200B;

*Reason 3:* Jim Cramer's wife loves the baconator and she can probably eat enough to keep the cash flowing just by herself. See this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFe8qtmIf-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFe8qtmIf-Y)

She's also not alone. Recently I was on tinder and I saw that the women were fatter than the last time I was on there. They have to be getting that way somehow, how you ask? The answer is fast food. Look for big time earnings coming up

&#x200B;

*Reason 4*: Here is Robinhood's description for Wendy's

*""It offers hamburgers and related products, such as chicken breast sandwiches, nuggets, chili, and baked potatoes, French fries, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, milk, coffee, frosty deserts, and kid’s meals.""* **<-If that didn't make you hungry you probably don't even fuckin eat at all**

&#x200B;

*Reason 5*: Always beats earnings, showing that hedgies and wall street analist suit dooches never correctly appreciate the value of this fast food alpha chad dominance machine

&#x200B;

*Reason 6*: extremely cheap low IV calls. I know some of you think that higher numbers are better but IV is not that way, it's like strikes in baseball not strikes in bowling

&#x200B;

Now I have given you three reasons but we all know ""you don't even need more than one reason to make money."" What are you waiting for?

&#x200B;

**TLDurrrrr: It doesn't matter if you're from Wall Street, Sesame Street, or the City of Compton, Wendy's is going to Jupiter 🚀🚀🚀**

**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**

This post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.

Let's assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn't necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I'll come back to this later.

Richard Wyckoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:

***""…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.""***

Aside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wyckoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.

**Accumulation** = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.

**Distribution** = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.

&#x200B;

Based off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the ""composite man"" behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.

Well slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?

Manipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.

This picture describes the Wyckoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? **THAT'S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT'S MARK-UP TIME!**

The far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can't give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.

I captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It's very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wyckoff's methods. I don't care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it's not.

It's highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I'm looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.

How do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? **We BUY, HODL, DRS.** We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. **Most importantly, we** **DRS**. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - **he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.** One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.

tuxtu7,1648950116.0,HMHC June 22.5 calls will 10-20x by next Friday,"So, you want alpha, anon? Well, let me spoon feed you it.

**TLDR: HMHC June 22.5 calls will 10 - 20x and HMHC stock will +15% by next Friday (May, Sept, Jan calls will print too).** Run the math yourself: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) 

Veritas has offered to buy HMHC at $21/share. Multiple prominent shareholders have stated publicly that they will be declining this low-bid offer but would be open at a fairer price ($25-$28). The deadline to decide all this is April 6. Once the shareholders decline this low-bid offer on April 6, Veritas will need to raise the offer +15% to win this asset, and still earn a monster 28% - 37% internal rate of return for their LPs (world class returns for private equity). ***This will send the June $22.5 calls up 10 to 20x instantly.*** 

**Here's why the buyout will not go through at this low price:**

Every shareholder who wanted to sell for $21 has already sold their shares for $21, as the stock has been trading at $21 for over a month now… They have had since February 22 to do so. (Math: 4M average daily volume \* 28 trading days since shares went to $21/share = 112M shares traded. There are 127M shares outstanding). Importantly, this means that the shareholders that remain in the stock are not interested in ""voting"" for this sale to Veritas for $21, unless the price is increased to a fairer price ($25 to $28+). This is not being reflected in the prices of the options = alpha to be had.  

According to Computershare: by March 29, ***two days before the original April 1 deadline, only 0.6% of shares were tendered in support of selling at this low price***, before Veritas extended that deadline one week. Source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220329005578/en/Expiration-Date-of-Tender-Offer-for-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Extended-to-April-6-2022](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220329005578/en/Expiration-Date-of-Tender-Offer-for-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Extended-to-April-6-2022)

***99.4% of shareholders refused to give up their shares at $21 which means a significant premium above $21 is needed for an acquirer win this asset, not for a measly 10% or 15%.*** Not yet reflected in the price = alpha.

**Here's why it’s in Veritas best interests to increase the bid +20% to win this asset:**

Veritas owns Cambium another leading EdTech business which would be a highly complementary asset to HMHC. They can be merged to realize synergies worth billions of dollars. 

Veritas managers are highly intelligent and would not say no to doing a deal at a 31% internal rate of return, just because they could not get the deal done at a 38% internal rate of return. 

Even if Veritas does not increase the bid, the market is determining the fair price of this asset. A rejected buyout offer demonstrates that $21 is too low a price, and the shares will likely rally regardless.

turtay,1648929749.0,GME - You MIGHT have to be a shareholder by early or mid-April to vote on the stock dividend plan in the annual meeting in June,"(I am not a financial advisor, this is PURELY speculative information for anyone interested to keep in mind)

**TL;DR - If this year's timeline resembles last year's, then you** ***might*** **have to be a GME shareholder by either April 7th or 14th to vote in the annual meeting where the stock dividend vote will occur.**

So now that we've all heard about GameStop's stock dividend plan, I figured I'd share a quick speculation which could be crucial for those who are not GME shareholders but plan to be at some point so that they can vote in the annual meeting. 

Below is the email I received from Fidelity in **May of 2021** regarding the GameStop annual meeting. You had to have been a shareholder as of **April 15th, 2021** in order to vote in the meeting. Note that the email notice was sent to me AFTER the deadline to be a shareholder. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xoprcsw26r81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e4923f4a9b557031aaa184c7bc682294b0a828

Now let's assume that this year's timeline was to mirror last year's. Since this year's meeting is at around the same time as last year's (I've heard it was on June 9th, but could be June 2nd, I don't know which is right), then it might be the case that you'd have to be a shareholder by either April 7th (for a June 2nd meeting) or April 14th (for a June 9th meeting). Unfortunately, you may get notified about this AFTER the deadline to become a shareholder if you started owning shares too late. 

Again, this is pure speculation, anything could be different this year.

tux705,1648944712.0,I have finally accepted that I am retarded.,"I started trading back at the start of Covid. Around the same time I found Wall Street bets. I was only 16 at the time so I just used my moms social security to make a Robinhood accountant. I started off like many autists just buying shares, mostly of things like American Airlines and carnival cruises. Most likely because they were cheap after the pandemic drop. As I realized shares weren’t making me shit I decided to learn about options. For a while I did horrible and went down almost a thousand dollars. Then the whole AMC/GME incident occurred and I was able to make the most money I’d ever made in my life putting my portfolio in the green by over a thousand. I then went on a hot streak and was able to grow this portfolio a couple more thousand dollars, regularly making withdrawals. As time went on and the meme stocks died out, I slowly went back to my old ways of buying shitty 3 day to expiration PLTR and NIO calls almost everyday, sometimes venturing into whatever other company I was used to trading previously. Now it’s been about 6 months that my trades have just been very stagnant and I am making no progress, losing money if anything. I thought a new portfolio when I turned 18 would refresh me but instead I just kept losing. My all time is technically still up but I feel it dwindling with each bad trade. This is what’s made me come to the realizing that I am retarded just like the rest of you and I am most likely not in the 1% of successful traders. Not to mention my strategy is to buy options at 3:58 and sell the next morning hoping for a run in the morning or gap up since I don’t have more then 3 day trades a week. Well with all that said, let’s hope these NIO calls I have for Monday do good and replenish all hope in me that I am successful again after 1 Green Day, and then I will let the cycle repeat after losing double the gains the next day.",False,149,0,Sethb_845,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tux705/i_have_finally_accepted_that_i_am_retarded/,False,164

tv47sl,1648973032.0,$TSLA prediction using Wyckoff Result vs Effort Model (AAPL reference),"First off, I'm not a financial advisor, I am an absolute idiot. 

So, this isn't going to be the best DD in the world, but I think it offers a pretty significant correlation between the $AAPL Daily chart that is referenced in the Result vs Effort Model that Richard Wyckoff taught. 

https://preview.redd.it/44ri3xqfs9r81.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=3baa5854b72f61080ea4cf5699b92a9666fd1ac6

What we are expecting here, is one last spike in volume on the decline, before a significant increase in value. I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. 

Not to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought. 

&#x200B;

[Wyckoff Price Cycle Visual](https://preview.redd.it/vt4js75ps9r81.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=a276aa9a7b62cb95c2d92d1ef24a5244344dfcbd)

The reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil.

tv7ym1,1648988197.0,Doom Vortex,"*Ukraine burns, bludgeoned by the invading Russian...*

In 2-3 years, the global monetary system will look nothing like it does today, and not enough people are considering the details of such a rapid disintegration:

Commodities are collateral, and collateral is money. Russia’s commodities are considered sub-prime, while the rest of the world’s are considered prime. This means that the price of commodities are falling inside sanctioned countries like Russia, but are rising outside of sanctioned countries. Commodities traders outside Russia have to borrow more money because of the collateral mismatch. But both the commodity traders inside and outside sanctioned countries are getting margin called while commodities basis soars.

Fertilizer price outside Russia for example:

[Green candle through heaven's floorboards](https://preview.redd.it/e40grh0d2br81.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5599e329e9dacc06fff2b43a9a602ceeb5774699)

Here’s a quick list of major Russian commodities as world percentages:

* 10% oil
* 45% of potash (needed for fertilizer, most beauty products, manufacturing, etc)
* 5% Wheat
* 5% Nickel
* 4% Aluminum
* 4% Copper

So the spread difference in this commodity pricing inside and outside Russia can be taken advantage of by China, who will effectively benefit by whatever the spread amount is. They can then control their own currency’s inflation by selling US Treasuries to buy Russian commodities. And because China is NOT a sanctioned country, that means they can then sell these Russian commodities to Europe, the US, or any other country putting sanctions on Russia. If they don’t have enough mainland space, they’ll put them on the ocean, driving up logistics costs for the rest of the world but ultimately stabilizing the basis. This means commodity shortages in the West, especially Europe. All this will put enormous pressure on western currencies and spike inflation further.

Then there’s the refugee crisis. The last one in Europe (circa 2007-2015) brought 5M people over those 8 years. Ukraine could bring 2x that in a fraction of the time. Then because of the coming food crisis thanks to much of Ukraine’s resources going offline, the Middle-East and Northern Africa will bring another huge wave. The last immigration crisis brought Brexit and an entirely new European political class. This will do the same, and will put more pressure on the Euro if their money printer’s heat doesn’t burn down their treasury first.

Here’s a quick list of major Ukraine commodities as world percentages:

* 11% wheat
* 13% maize
* 10% potatoes
* 10% potash
* 80% of neon gas (needed for semiconductor lasers)

This is all beyond any western Central Bank’s ability to backstop or fix, because it’s not a liquidity crisis. The inflation from the soaring basis will have to be cooled with rate hikes. But if that’s the case, where does money turn to for safety if the stock market is tumbling, Treasury demand has fallen off a cliff, USD/EURO is inflating away, and commodities are volatile? Real estate? Probably not because although interest rates will still be too low for savers at say 3% (because inflation is 10% or more) these rates will start to be too high for the easy money real estate borrowers are drunk on.

Many countries, companies, and players (especially in the East), will turn to the Yuan as a larger percentage of their cash holdings seeing it no less dangerously than they do the USD after G7 nations foolishly seized a sovereign country’s (Russia’s) foreign reserves, and because it's not inflating as rapidly, and most importantly, because they're buying those re-routed Russian commodities with it. This is where the petrodollar can start to really breakdown, adding more inflationary pressure on the USD. Many country's will turn to gold as well.

I won’t get into the Triffin Dilemma here, but its doom vortex is churning the USD into an impending disaster as early as winter this year and into the next couple years. Triffin predicted eventually the USD would collapse like this after it had backed itself into a corner.

[Blockbuster](https://preview.redd.it/3k5e0dsi2br81.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04eb6d5fc753c304c8bfd6eb5f5bb5941dc1e363)

And this is why 2022 is an important year for digital gold accumulation, because more than anything, many large players will choose to hedge and save their buying power in digital gold, and buying power is the most powerful tool for investors and traders.

Sanctions serve absolutely no purpose other than SYMBOLISM, because what they actually do is erode supply chains further, benefit China, strengthen their currency, and make you and I pay for it with ours. YOU are the one financing this conflict and these sanctions, which is why I needed to write this post, to give some perspective. This is why you have to make the asymmetric trade for digital gold every time you touch US dollars THIS YEAR. There’s a disaster coming and we’re sleepwalking into it.

Lastly, you have to consider the fact that the CBDC does not fix any of the USD’s larger global problems. None. In fact, they make them worse because a CBDC is not actually fungible money. My view is that CBDC’s will be used to pay entitlements and be either spent quickly, or converted into what people save their wealth in at a small premium: digital gold, a network which will simply be the base layer that the new monetary system builds around--and this dear reader, is a base layer that’s been missing for quite some time.

Support \~432

Resistance \~452

The decreasing volumes levels are not the best sign since there is more attention on the stock market, this shows more people are just waiting on the sidelines figuring out what to do.

I explained last week my theory on why we will have quick movements of panic sells or bull runs, this happens because of the unusual increase in retail option buying activity and market makers hedging the contracts they wrote.  After this recent bull run I believe that we are in another period of consolidation before the next big move, this should last at least a few weeks.

Using the overall downtrend from the current year this shows that statistically what happened on Tuesday when SPY closed up at 461.6 was unusual and could not happen by chance alone.  Something at least had an influence on the markets that was unexpected.

**Predictions**

 So there really is nothing happening this week, which makes me think something is going to happen.  This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. 

I remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  

In 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).

https://preview.redd.it/2esx9y1cj5r81.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fde35e21b44ac9431af1b9ac3d3b02cf85793

The Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.  Unemployment cannot fall any lower... this could be the end of a growth cycle in the markets.  

Next few months will be bearish, this week we will have consolidation with a downward trend, I am not expecting any major movements.

1. There are a few things you should have set up beforehand. First an LLC so you can use the house for a business loan against it. Second, actually buy a house either in cash or mortgage (ideally you will pay this off within a month or two).
2. Now that you have the set up you need to sell the house to your LLC to repay your loan and make it no longer your property.
3. Now use that house as collateral for a business loan to get 5x your portion of equity in the house and begin trading with that money.
4. Further leverage that money with 8x margin trading with in the brokerage account
5. As an individual you are now having your housing being paid by your LLC’s trades but with no risk of losing it all because if something bad happens you file for bankruptcy the bank takes your house and sells it as quick as possible you come in and buy it for less then it’s actually worth. All this with a net loss of 1/40 th of your initial buying power.

Extras: if you ever feel you want to cash out or limit risk, give yourself a position in the business like “trade analyst” and pay yourself based on performance.

Lora Kolodny
Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022.

Here’s how they did.

Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310,048

Electric vehicle production (total): 305,407

Over the same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the first quarter of 2022, according to Tesla.

The company produced 4,641 fewer cars than it delivered during the quarter citing “ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.”

Analysts expected deliveries of 317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31. The estimates ranged from a low of 278,000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357,000.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

The company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg, Germany, and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and “cyber rodeo” event on April 7, at another new vehicle assembly plant it’s building in Austin, Texas.

Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin officially as of Dec. 1, but still operates its first electric car factory in Fremont, California.

Globally, Tesla’s operations during the quarter, which ended March 31, were weighed down by a Covid surge and new health restrictions in China, requiring temporary production halts at its Shanghai plant. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs, marking a record for the company. 

Tesla, along with the rest of the auto industry, has also been hurt by widespread parts shortages, and inflation. Critical components like semiconductors remain in short supply, and prices have increased for raw materials like nickel and aluminum after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February. In the U.S., Tesla has been leaving customers waiting for months before filling their car orders.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned in mid-March of inflationary pressures on the business, and hiked the prices of its cars in both the U.S. and China.",False,58,0,nerdyspartan12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tupu14/tesla_delivers_310048_electric_vehicles_in_the/,False,18

SoftBank has liquidated almost all of the positions in its abortive internal hedge fund SB Northstar after racking up between $6bn and $7bn in losses in the unit behind the notorious “Nasdaq whale” trades.

  The writing has been on the wall for the Japanese technology conglomerate’s buccaneering trading unit since November, when SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son told investors “the company called SB Northstar . . . is about to come to an end”.  Akshay Naheta, the former Deutsche Bank trader based in Abu Dhabi who ran the unit, left SoftBank on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

 The 40-year-old is known for executing complex derivative transactions and earned notoriety for spearheading SoftBank’s controversial bet on the shares of fraudulent payments company Wirecard.  

Regulatory filings show that SB Management — Northstar’s investment manager — held a little over $1bn in US-listed stocks at the end of 2021, down from more than $17bn one year earlier. The bulk of its remaining positions were in special purpose acquisition companies, including vehicles sponsored by its own Vision Fund, SoftBank shareholder Elliott Management and Vision Fund investor Mubadala. 

  
The winding down of Northstar comes as SoftBank looks to slow investments across the group as it seeks to raise cash amid falling tech stocks and a regulatory crackdown in China. 

  
A person familiar with its portfolio said that most of its European investments were liquidated around the same time, including a $5bn bet on Swiss drugmaker Roche that had been profitable. 

The person added that there were less than a handful of positions left, which had been transferred to SoftBank Group.  “I don’t think there’s a reason for them to dump anything else immediately, because there are other things that they can sell that are more liquid,” he said, noting that a recent rebound in SoftBank’s Chinese technology stocks had eased pressure on the group to raise cash.

  In its 2021 annual results presentation last month, SoftBank disclosed that Northstar had lost $4.6bn over the course of its brief existence, mainly because of disastrous derivative bets. One person familiar with its trading activity said this would likely climb to $6bn following the liquidation, while another pegged it at close to $7bn.

  SoftBank said: “As Mr Son explained during SoftBank’s earnings presentation last November, SB Northstar’s activities and its portfolio have been significantly reduced.”  SoftBank launched Northstar in August 2020 with initial capital of $555mn — a third of this coming from Son himself. That disguised the unit’s far larger firepower, obtained through loans of cash and publicly traded securities from SoftBank’s vast balance sheet.",False,44,0,Zilllnaijaboy99,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tuhozb/softbank_liquidates_sb_northstar_fund_that_racked/,False,19

tuc135,1648879708.0,The 2/10 year yield curve has inverted,"Debt is more risky when it's held over a longer time period. Therefore, 10 year bonds are supposed to have higher yields than the 2 year. Yield curve inversion indicates that the bond market sees significant risk higher risk of default in the short term.

This recession indicator predicted the last 10 out of 11 recessions. There's generally a lead time of 6 to 15 months once the yield curve inverts. The yield curve works so well because delusional optimists will always ignore it and claim that ""it's different this time"".

During June of last year, I predicted that inflation would explode and the Fed will cause a market crash combating inflation by jacking up rates. I was right about inflation but wrong about the Fed's response to inflation. It takes positive real interest rates to effectively fight a run-away inflation. Interest rates needs to be higher than the inflation rate to achieve that.

If inflation doesn't cool down, the endgame is either double digit inflation or a painful long term bear market that can last for many years. It can potentially be both like what we saw in the 1970s.

Stocks are vulnerable because leverage and debt that are sensitive to interest rates. Companies with D/E greater than 1.0 and negative cashflow are at risk of bankruptcy in a long term bear market. Commodities are the only real hedge against inflation. The yield curve is the confirmation I needed to go on the big short 2.0

tvhaio,1649013584.0,rebuilding Ukraine,"hi everyone,

now that the Ukraine war is getting towards the end, I started to think about the large-scale rebuilding effort that will be undertaken as soon as the conflict is over. therefore I wanted to ask which companies in your opinion are best positioned to profit from that? id guess steel/concrete-manufacturers are up there but im interested in your opinions.

clarify: I think the war is close to an end because russia will now concentrate on the eastern parts. they will increase their presence there and then are likely to negotiate a deal in which they can keep the eastern parts in exchange for stopping the military operation.

plus, even if it takes some time for the war to end, Ukraine will have to be rebuilt one day, so I think it makes sense to think about that rn

ttvz3f,1648833063.0,House approves bill legalizing marijuana,"https://thehill.com/news/house/3256370-house-approves-bill-legalizing-marijuana/

The House passed legislation on Friday to legalize marijuana nationwide and eliminate the longstanding criminal penalties for anyone who distributes or possesses it. 

Lawmakers passed the bill largely along party lines, 220-204, with three Republicans joining all but two Democrats in support.

The measure now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) is working with fellow Democrats to introduce a marijuana legalization bill as soon as this spring.  

But it’s not clear a bill to broadly legalize marijuana could clear the necessary 60 votes to advance in the Senate.

Schumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal.   

Schumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal. 

House Democrats previously passed a bill to legalize marijuana in December 2020. But that measure didn’t go anywhere in the Senate, which was still under GOP control at the time.    

The bill, titled the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, would clear marijuana-related convictions from people’s records and formally remove it from the federal list of controlled substances. 

The legislation would also impose a federal tax on marijuana sales to fund programs aimed at helping communities harmed by the so-called “war on drugs” policies that established harsh punishments for distributing and using drugs.  

The sales tax would start at 5 percent, and gradually increase to 8 percent over five years. 

Proponents argued that it’s past time for the federal government to catch up to the majority of states that have legalized marijuana to at least some extent. 

“For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice problem instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chief sponsor of the bill.  

“If states are the laboratories of democracy, it is long past time for the federal government to recognize that legalization has been a resounding success and the conflict with federal law has become untenable,” Nadler said. 

Before final passage, the House rejected an amendment from Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) to clarify that people can’t be denied security clearances over marijuana use due to 12 Democrats joining all but two Republicans in opposition.

Democrats further framed the measure as a way to reverse the disproportionate impact of criminalizing marijuana on racial minorities. Black Americans are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession despite both races using the drug at roughly the same rate, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 

“Make no mistake. Yes, it is a racial justice bill,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair and member of the Congressional Black Caucus. 

Republicans argued that marijuana is enough of a mind-altering substance to pose a threat to society.       

“Record crime, record inflation, record gas prices, record number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border, and what are Democrats doing today? Legalizing drugs. Legalizing drugs and using American tax dollars to kick start and prop up the marijuana industry. Wow,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. 

At least 37 states, four territories and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical use, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. About half that number – 18 states, two territories and the nation’s capital – allow it for non-medical use. 

Some Republicans who support legalizing marijuana opposed House Democrats’ bill on Friday, arguing there should have been a more bipartisan approach. 

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) called for bringing the legislation on the House floor on Friday closer to her own marijuana legalization bill, which would limit marijuana use to people above the age of 21 and establish a lower sales tax that would not rise for ten years. 

“I have incentives for states not to sell to kids or market or advertise to kids,” Mace told The Hill. “My tax is a lot lower at 3 percent. Theirs is eight after three years, and we all know that you’re going to guarantee illicit markets if you make taxes too high.” 

Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair, wrote in an op-ed for Marijuana Moment, a publication that focuses on marijuana policy, that he would not support the bill on Friday either. 

“To responsibly end prohibition, the federal government must simultaneously issue a regulatory framework that works in conjunction with states’ specifics needs. The MORE Act lacks this critical element or any meaningful and immediate regulatory safeguards at all, leaving individual states to sort out issues typically reserved for federal agencies in the interim,” Joyce wrote. 

The House has passed legislation multiple times in the past year to allow legally operating marijuana businesses to access banking services and credit cards, so that they don’t have to be cash-only. So far, nine Senate Republicans have signed on as cosponsors to Sen. Jeff Merkley’s (D-Ore.) companion bill in the upper chamber for more narrow marijuana legalization.",False,702,0,Jozoman,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ttvz3f/house_approves_bill_legalizing_marijuana/,False,179
